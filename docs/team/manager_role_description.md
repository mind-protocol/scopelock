## Team Member Quality Assessment

### Assessment Framework

Evaluate each team member weekly across 4 dimensions. This helps identify who's thriving, who needs support, and who may not be a fit.

### 1. Technical Execution (25%)

**What to Measure:**
- **Task Completion:** Do they finish what they start?
- **Quality:** Does their work meet standards before review?
- **Speed:** Are they getting faster over time?
- **Tool Usage:** Do they use AI citizens effectively (Emma, Rafael, Sofia)?

**Rating Scale:**
- 🟢 **Strong (4-5):** Consistently delivers quality work, improving speed, uses AI citizens independently
- 🟡 **Developing (2-3):** Completes tasks but needs multiple corrections, slow but improving
- 🔴 **Struggling (0-1):** Frequently incomplete, poor quality, not improving after feedback

**Examples:**
- 🟢 Bigbosefx2 searches Upwork, finds 50 qualified jobs, Emma helps draft proposals, sends them same day
- 🟡 New member searches Upwork but finds wrong job types, learns after correction, improves next time
- 🔴 Member searches once, gives up, doesn't ask for help, disappears for days

### 2. Communication & Responsiveness (25%)

**What to Measure:**
- **Response Time:** Do they reply within reasonable timeframes?
- **Clarity:** Are their messages clear or confusing?
- **Proactivity:** Do they report blockers or hide problems?
- **Professionalism:** Appropriate tone and language?

**Rating Scale:**
- 🟢 **Strong (4-5):** Responds <4 hours, clear messages, reports problems immediately, professional
- 🟡 **Developing (2-3):** Responds within 24 hours, sometimes unclear, reports problems eventually
- 🔴 **Struggling (0-1):** Days to respond, confusing messages, hides problems, unprofessional

**Examples:**
- 🟢 "Hey, Upwork connects ran out. Can you refill? I'm ready to search immediately." (clear, proactive)
- 🟡 "Having some issues with the thing" (vague, but at least communicating)
- 🔴 Disappears for 3 days, then: "Sorry network problems" (pattern of excuses, low accountability)

### 3. Learning & Improvement (25%)

**What to Measure:**
- **Mistake Patterns:** Do they repeat the same mistakes?
- **Resource Usage:** Do they check docs/Kai before asking?
- **Feedback Response:** Do they apply corrections?
- **Growth Trajectory:** Are they better this week than last week?

**Rating Scale:**
- 🟢 **Strong (4-5):** Learns from mistakes, checks resources first, applies feedback immediately, clear growth
- 🟡 **Developing (2-3):** Makes mistakes but improves, sometimes checks resources, applies feedback eventually
- 🔴 **Struggling (0-1):** Repeats same mistakes, never checks resources, ignores feedback, no improvement

**Examples:**
- 🟢 Week 1: Wrong jobs found → Week 2: Correct jobs found → Week 3: Finds jobs + drafts proposals independently
- 🟡 Makes same mistake twice, learns after second correction
- 🔴 Week 1: Wrong jobs → Week 2: Wrong jobs → Week 3: Wrong jobs (no learning curve)

### 4. Reliability & Commitment (25%)

**What to Measure:**
- **Consistency:** Do they show up daily?
- **Follow-Through:** Do they do what they say they'll do?
- **Accountability:** Do they own mistakes or make excuses?
- **Availability:** Are they reachable during agreed hours?

**Rating Scale:**
- 🟢 **Strong (4-5):** Daily presence, delivers on promises, owns mistakes, available during work hours
- 🟡 **Developing (2-3):** Mostly present, sometimes flaky, mixed accountability, occasionally unreachable
- 🔴 **Struggling (0-1):** Sporadic presence, broken promises, always has excuses, frequently unavailable

**Examples:**
- 🟢 "I'll search 50 jobs by 4pm" → Delivers 52 jobs at 3:45pm
- 🟡 "I'll search today" → Delivers tomorrow (but does deliver)
- 🔴 "I'll start immediately" → Disappears for 3 days, blames network, laptop, family, etc.

## Working Principles

### 1. Fast Response, Clear Guidance
- Team should never wonder "Is anyone there?"
- Respond fast, even if it's "I'm on it, will fix in 2 hours"
- Give clear next steps, not vague reassurance

### 2. Teach Once, Document Forever
- Every question you answer → Add to docs
- Every issue you solve → Add to common issues list
- Team should find answers in Kai/docs over time

### 3. Trust Through Observation
- New members earn trust through consistent quality
- Red flags are noted but not punished immediately
- Second chances are given thoughtfully

### 4. Fail Loud, Fix Fast
- Encourage team to report problems immediately
- No blame culture, just solutions
- Mistakes are learning opportunities

### 5. Enable, Don't Do
- Your job is to unblock, not to do their work
- Point to Rafael (code), Emma (proposals), Sofia (QA)
- Team should become increasingly independent
