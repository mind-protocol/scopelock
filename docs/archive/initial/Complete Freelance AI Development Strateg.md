## Why These Specific Prices

### Entry Level: $5,000 for 48-Hour MVP

**Market Research Justification:**
- Basic landing pages average **$2,500-3,500** for 1-3 week timeline
- We deliver in 48 hours = **10x speed** = justified 2x price

- Our 48-hour version at $5K is actually **cheaper per day**
- **$5K is the psychological threshold** where businesses take it seriously
- Below $5K attracts **problem clients** (data shows low-budget = high maintenance)
- Upwork data: Projects requiring **15+ connects** have median budget of $1,200
- Our $5K positions us in **high-value segment** requiring serious connects

**Strategic Reasoning:**
- Filters out tire-kickers immediately

## Why 48-Hour Delivery

### The Market Demand Data

- Even "fast" freelancers say **1 week minimum**
- 48 hours is **literally unbelievable** (until proven)
- Creates immediate differentiation

### Why Not 24 Hours?

**Credibility Threshold:**
- 24 hours sounds like scam/low quality
- 48 hours sounds aggressive but possible

### Why Not 72 Hours or 1 Week?

**Psychological Impact:**
