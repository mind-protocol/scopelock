# ScopeLock Branding Quick Reference

**Purpose:** Fast lookup during proposal writing. Full details in `branding_communication_guide.md`

## Is Client Process-Skeptical? (Quick Check)

**YES if post contains:**
- "No Agencies"
- Mentions bad past experiences
- Cynical/defensive tone
- Detailed verification requirements
- Budget-constrained (<$5K)

**→ Use:** Plain terminology, deliverables-first, add "What's the catch?"

**NO if post contains:**
- Technical CTO at funded startup
- Positive mentions of "process," "methodology"
- Asks for "acceptance criteria," "CI/CD"
- Budget ≥$10K

**→ Use:** Full ScopeLock terminology, process-first

## Terminology Quick Map

| If Process-Skeptical | If Process-Friendly |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| "Milestone 1/2" | "Evidence Sprint" |
| "tests pass" | "AC green" |
| "Here's the actual work:" | "Here's how we work:" |
| Deliverables list THEN process | Process explanation THEN deliverables |
| No "ScopeLock" branding in signature | "ScopeLock — Lock the scope" in signature |

## Proof Links (Always Include)

```
You can verify our work at github.com/nlr-ai (personal) and
github.com/mind-protocol (org - includes terminal-velocity with
1.1k stars, therapykin, kinkong).
```

**Plus relevant portfolio project:**[platform not up anymore], konginvest.ai, therapykin.ai

## "What's the Catch?" Template

**Add for process-skeptical clients:**

```
What's the catch?

"Pay only when tests pass" sounds too good. Here's how it works:
acceptance criteria are executable tests in code, not subjective
judgment. When the tests pass, milestone is done. If you want to
change the criteria, that's a scope change (priced upfront). If
tests pass but it's still broken, I fix the tests and code at no
charge—that's on me.
```

## The Pushback Formula

**First sentence must challenge something:**

- "Seven deliverables is ambitious for $3,000"
- "Two weeks is tight for this scope"
- "That stack choice will create problems with [X]"

**Why:** Peer positioning, shows experience, differentiates from yes-men

---

## Question Close Examples

**NOT:** "When do we start?" or "Looking forward to working with you!"

**YES:**
- "What does a 'good' [X] look like to you (specific data points, tone, detail level)?"
- "Which matters more: speed or feature completeness?"
- "What's the real deadline vs the posted deadline?"

**Why:** Shows strategic thinking, forces engagement

## Never Say (Any Client)

❌ excited, honored, passionate, perfect fit, I'd love to, thrilled
❌ "I can work X hours per day"
❌ "48h delivery"
❌ Superlatives about yourself

**When in doubt:** Assume process-skeptical. Can add terminology later, can't remove friction once triggered.
