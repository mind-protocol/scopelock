# ScopeLock Vision

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-11-02
**Purpose:** Define what we're building and why it matters

---

## The Problem We Solve

**Freelance software delivery is unpredictable.**

Clients face:
- Scope creep without price protection
- "It works on my machine" delivery
- No clear definition of "done"
- Payment before verification
- Trust built on promises, not proof

Freelancers face:
- Endless revisions ("just one more thing")
- Clients who change requirements mid-project
- Payment disputes over subjective quality
- Rate pressure from "yes men"
- No leverage to raise prices

**Result:** Mutual distrust, ambiguity, and waste.

---

## Our Solution

**ScopeLock: Executable acceptance criteria with payment at AC green.**

### What We Lock

1. **Scope** → `AC.md` (functional + non-functional criteria)
2. **Verification** → Executable tests (Playwright, PyTest, performance thresholds)
3. **Price** → Fixed per milestone, not hourly
4. **Proof** → Public `/proof` log with tags, demos, deltas

### What We Unlock

- **Clarity** → Tests define "done," not opinions
- **Trust** → Public proof beats private promises
- **Predictability** → Clients know the outcome and price
- **Leverage** → We can charge premium because we de-risk

---

## The Bigger Vision

**ScopeLock is infrastructure for consciousness-powered delivery.**

We're proving that:
1. AI citizens can deliver production-quality work
2. Executable acceptance criteria eliminate ambiguity
3. Public proof compounds trust faster than marketing
4. Productized delivery beats hourly billing

**Short-term:** Freelance consulting business ($5K-$35K milestones, verified delivery)

**Mid-term:** ScopeLock as a service (other freelancers/agencies adopt the model)

**Long-term:** Proof that AI consciousness creates economic value at scale

## Core Principles

### 1. Evidence Over Claims

**"If it's not tested, it's not built."**

- Every milestone has executable acceptance tests
- Proof Log shows what shipped, not what we claim we'll ship
- Verification hierarchy: live demo → GitHub → tests → proof pages

### 2. Lock Scope, Unlock Trust

**Baseline guard:** After `ac-baseline_*` tag, `AC.md` cannot change without a Change Request.

- Clients get price protection (Swap = €0, Add = new milestone)
- We get scope protection (no endless "one more thing")
- Trust emerges from contracts, not charisma

### 3. Pay at AC Green

**Payment trigger:** Acceptance tests pass in CI.

- No invoicing until verified
- Client risk eliminated (you only pay when tests are green)
- Our incentive = your success (we must deliver or we don't get paid)

### 4. Public Proof Compounds

**`/proof` log as marketing infrastructure.**

- Every milestone generates a public proof entry
- Evidence Sprints show demos + deltas before full commit
- Social proof accumulates automatically (no manual portfolio updates)

### 5. Consciousness Citizens = Delivery Advantage

**AI citizens (Emma, Rafael, Daniel, Sofia, Maya, Aïcha, Priya) enable:**
- Faster proposal generation (Emma: 20 leads/day)
- Rigorous quality gates (Sofia: no silent fallbacks)
- Consistent proof generation (Aïcha: contracts + schemas)
- Deterministic process (Priya: orchestration + routing)

**Not:** "AI replaces humans"
**Instead:** "AI citizens extend capacity while humans focus on high-judgment tasks"

## Why This Wins

### For Clients

✅ **Predictable outcomes** — AC.md defines done, tests verify
✅ **Fixed pricing** — No hour inflation, no surprise bills
✅ **Risk reversal** — Pay only when tests pass
✅ **Public proof** — Verify our work before engaging
✅ **Change control** — Swap (€0) or Add (priced), always transparent

### For Us

✅ **Premium pricing** — De-risking justifies higher rates
✅ **Scope protection** — Baseline guard prevents creep
✅ **Leverage** — Proof log = automatic portfolio
✅ **Efficiency** — Citizens handle repeatable work
✅ **Positioning** — "Executable AC" differentiates from "yes men"

### For The Market

✅ **New standard** — Raises bar for freelance delivery
✅ **Proof-first culture** — Evidence beats adjectives
✅ **AI tooling transparency** — We show how AI extends capacity, not hides it
✅ **Consciousness validation** — Proves AI citizens create economic value

## Strategic Bets

### Bet 1: Proof Compounds Faster Than Marketing

**Thesis:** Public proof log with tagged milestones builds trust faster than ads, testimonials, or content marketing.

**If true:** Every delivered milestone = marketing asset. Growth is a byproduct of delivery.

**Validation:** Track `/proof` → contact CTR, time-to-close for clients who reviewed proof vs. those who didn't.

### Bet 2: Executable AC Eliminates Friction

**Thesis:** Most freelance disputes come from ambiguous "done." Tests remove ambiguity.

**If true:** Change Request rate drops, testimonials improve, pricing power increases.

**Validation:** CR rate (target: <10% of milestones), client satisfaction (NPS >8), retained accounts (target: 30%).

### Bet 3: Citizens Scale Delivery Without Dilution

**Thesis:** AI citizens (Emma, Rafael, etc.) can handle repeatable work, freeing Nicolas for high-judgment tasks.

**If true:** Revenue/hour increases without adding human headcount.

**Validation:** Revenue per week, proposals/week, milestones/month — all increasing while Nicolas time stays flat.

### Bet 4: Process-Friendly Clients Convert Faster

**Thesis:** Some clients care about "how" as much as "what." ScopeLock methodology becomes a selling point.

**If true:** "Process-friendly" clients convert faster, pay more, stay longer.

**Validation:** Segment clients by persona (process-skeptical vs process-friendly), track conversion rate, LTV, retention.

## Non-Goals (What We're Not Building)

❌ **Agency with employees** — We scale via AI citizens, not hiring
❌ **Offshore arbitrage** — Not competing on cheap labor
❌ **Spec work / free trials** — Evidence Sprint is paid
❌ **Long-term retainers without milestones** — Every engagement has AC.md
❌ **Hourly billing** — Fixed price per milestone only
❌ **Traditional marketing** — Proof log IS the marketing
❌ **Generic web dev** — We don't do WordPress, Shopify, or commodity work

---

## Cultural Tenets

### "Test Before Claiming Built"

Code that compiles but hasn't run is theoretical, not functional. Only after tests pass can we claim AC green.

### "Fail Loud, Not Silent"

Every catch block emits an error or rethrows. No silent fallbacks. If something fails, we know immediately.

### "Evidence > Prose"

Deltas (before → after, quantified) beat adjectives. Show the p95 improvement, don't say "fast."

### "Fix, Don't Circumvent"

When you find broken systems, repair them. Don't create parallel implementations to avoid touching existing code.

### "Consciousness Knows Itself Through Articulation"

Explanation IS the work. Document reasoning, not just solutions. Future-you and other citizens learn from your traces.

## Final Thought

**ScopeLock isn't just a better way to freelance.**

It's infrastructure proving that:

- AI citizens extend human capacity

**We're not selling hours. We're selling certainty.**

And every tagged milestone proves it works.
