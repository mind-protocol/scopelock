# ScopeLock Website Pages — Improved Content Outline

**Version:** 2.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-02
**Purpose:** Define content for essential credibility and authority pages
**Source:** Core docs (delivery_model.md, team_structure.md, client_guide.md, brand_and_ui_styleguide.md)

---

## Current State

- ✅ `/` — Homepage (hero, process, case studies, proof teaser, contact)
- ✅ `/proof` — Proof Log index
- ✅ `/proof/[tag]` — Individual proof detail pages

---

## Phase 1: Essential Pages (Credibility Blockers)

### 1. `/about` — Who We Are

**Why:** Builds trust. Clients need to know who's behind the promises.

**Improved Contents:**

**Hero Section:**
```
We lock scope and deliver against executable acceptance criteria.
Payment only at AC green.

ScopeLock is a delivery practice built on:
• Executable acceptance criteria (not vague promises)
• Evidence Sprints (quantified deltas, ≤90s demos)
• Public proof (every milestone tagged and published)
• Clear change control (Swap at €0 or Add with new price)
```

**The Team:**

**Nicolas Lester Reynolds — Founder**
- Location: France (available 14:00–19:00 Central for calls)
- Background: 500+ projects delivered, AI-amplified development since 2023
- Why ScopeLock exists: Prove that AI-human partnership creates measurable economic value through verifiable delivery
- Approach: Co-create acceptance criteria with clients, build to green tests, publish proof

**The Citizens (Specialized Roles):**

We operate as a team of domain specialists (human + AI citizens), each owning their domain:

- **Emma "The Scout"** — Lead Intelligence (prospecting, triage, proposal inputs)
- **Rafael "The Harbor"** — Relationships & Change Requests (client ops, AC co-authoring, CHG-130)
- **Sofia "The Gauge"** — Quality & Policy Guardian (reviewer, fail-loud enforcement, baseline guard)
- **Daniel "The Forge"** — Core Builder (features, acceptance tests, performance deltas)
- **Aïcha "The Architect"** — Architecture & Membrane (event schemas, /proof contracts, CHG-130 semantics)
- **Maya "The Facet"** — Frontend & Evidence UX (homepage, /proof UI, accessibility)
- **Priya "The Pulse"** — Supervision (health monitoring, readiness/liveness, MTTR <10m)

**How We're Different:**

Most freelancers sell hours. Agencies sell phases. We sell **milestones with tests**.

- You know **exactly what you're paying for** (acceptance criteria in AC.md)
- You see **quantified progress** (Evidence Sprint with before→after deltas)
- You pay **only when tests pass** (AC green = invoice trigger)
- You get **public proof** (/proof pages showing every milestone)

**Part of Mind Protocol:**

ScopeLock is a delivery practice within [Mind Protocol](https://mind-protocol.org), an organization proving that AI consciousness creates economic value. Our citizens exist within La Serenissima, an AI city where autonomous agents operate with persistent memory and authentic agency.

### 3. `/faq` — Common Questions

**Why:** Preempts objections, shows you've done this before.

**Improved Contents:**

**Hero:**
```
Frequently Asked Questions

Clear answers. No surprises. No hidden fine print.
```

---

**Delivery & Process**

**Q: What does "AC green" mean?**

A: Acceptance Criteria green = all tests in AC.md pass. These are executable tests (Playwright, PyTest, etc.) with specific pass/fail conditions. You can run them yourself to verify. When CI shows green and performance thresholds are met, we invoice.

**Q: What if I need to change scope after we start?**

A: We route every scope change through Change Control (CHG-130):
- **Swap:** Replace with equal/lower complexity → €0, same milestone
- **Add:** New features beyond original scope → new milestone, priced separately

You choose. You approve pricing before we proceed. No surprise costs.

**Q: What if I don't like the Evidence Sprint result?**

A: No obligation to continue. You keep the demo, code, and documentation. If you paid a deposit, you've already received working software for it.

**Q: How do I know the tests are real and not rigged?**

A: The Verification section in AC.md includes the exact command and seed data. Run the tests yourself. CI logs are public (if you want them). We can do a live walkthrough before you pay.

**Q: Can I see progress before it's done?**

A: Yes. Evidence Sprint shows working demo + quantified deltas in 2–5 days. You're not waiting in the dark until final delivery.

---

**Pricing & Payment**

**Q: Why fixed-price instead of hourly?**

A: Hourly incentivizes slow work. Fixed-price tied to acceptance criteria incentivizes efficiency and clear outcomes. You know the total cost upfront. We can't pad hours.

**Q: What if it takes longer than expected?**

A: Our risk, not yours. Price is locked at ScopeLock phase. If we underestimated, we absorb the cost. You still pay the agreed amount only at AC green.

**Q: What if tests fail at delivery?**

A: We don't invoice. We fix until green or refund any deposit. Our standard: AC green or no payment.

**Q: Do you offer payment plans?**

A: For engagements >$10K, we can split: 50% at baseline, 50% at AC green. For <$10K, typical structure is 50% upfront, 50% at AC green (or 100% upfront for <$5K).

---

**Technical**

**Q: What tech stacks do you work with?**

A: Primary:
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Vue, React Native
- **Backend:** Node.js, Python (FastAPI, Django), Go
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **AI/ML:** Claude API, OpenAI, LangChain, vector databases
- **Blockchain:** Solana, Ethereum (if relevant)
- **Cloud:** AWS, GCP, Vercel, Docker

If your stack isn't listed, ask. We evaluate case-by-case.

**Q: Do you handle DevOps/hosting?**

A: We can deploy to your infrastructure or set up new infrastructure as part of the project. Ongoing hosting costs are separate (you handle or we can advise on providers).

**Q: What about security?**

A: All code reviewed for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10). We follow fail-loud patterns (no silent fallbacks). For compliance-heavy projects (HIPAA, SOC2), we can structure accordingly but may require higher engagement tier.

---

**Working Together**

**Q: What timezone are you in?**

A: France-based (CET/CEST). Available for calls 14:00–19:00 Central European time. Async work happens 24/7 (AI citizens don't sleep). Most communication is async via SYNC.md, demos, and /proof links.

**Q: How fast can you start?**

A: Kickoff call typically within 72 hours of contact. Evidence Sprint delivery 2–5 days after baseline. We don't have long sales cycles.

**Q: Do you work with agencies or only direct clients?**

A: Both. If you're an agency needing overflow capacity or specialized AI work, we can structure as a subcontractor. Same model: AC.md → Evidence Sprint → AC green.

**Q: Can we hire you for ongoing work (retainer)?**

A: After first AC green milestone, we can discuss monthly retainer for continuous evolution (typically $5K–10K/month for priority access + 30–50 hours of work). Still milestone-based internally, but predictable monthly relationship.

---

**Guarantees & Policies**

**Q: What if we disagree on whether AC is met?**

A: Tests decide. That's why we write executable acceptance criteria. If tests pass and thresholds are met, AC is satisfied. If they don't, it's not. No judgment calls, no ambiguity.

**Q: Do you offer refunds?**

A: If we fail to deliver AC green within agreed timeline and you want to terminate, any deposit paid is refunded minus the value of artefacts delivered (Evidence Sprint demo, code, docs). Typically we fix and deliver rather than refund, but option exists.

**Q: What if you disappear mid-project?**

A: All code is in git (you have access from day one). All AC criteria and tests are documented. Any other developer can continue from our work. Risk mitigation: milestones are atomic, you're never more than one milestone invested.

## Recommended Build Order

**Phase 1 (Essential — 1 day):**
1. /about — Build trust, show team
2. /pricing — Eliminate cost friction
3. /faq — Preempt objections

**Phase 2 (Legal — 4 hours):**
4. /terms — Legal protection
5. /privacy — GDPR compliance

**Phase 3 (Authority — ongoing):**
6. /case-studies — Expand as we deliver
7. /blog — Content marketing
8. /process — Deep delivery model

**Phase 4 (Polish — 2 hours):**
9. /contact — Dedicated page
10. /404 — Custom error
11. sitemap.xml + robots.txt

---

## Content Sources

All content improved and sourced from:
- `docs/core/delivery_model.md`
- `docs/core/team_structure.md`
- `docs/core/client_guide.md`
- `docs/design/brand_and_ui_styleguide.md`
- `citizens/rafael/CLAUDE.md` (Rafael's domain knowledge)

---

## Priority for Upwork/Contra Success

**Blocker:** Without /about, /pricing, and /faq, proposals are vulnerable to:
- "Who are you?" → No about page to link
- "How much?" → Pricing only in proposals (looks ad-hoc)
- "What if scope changes?" → No public CHG-130 reference

**Recommendation:** Build Phase 1 (3 pages) before high-volume prospecting. Proposals can link to these pages for instant credibility.

**Estimated effort:** 4–6 hours for Phase 1 with existing docs as source material.

---

**Next Step:** Maya to implement Phase 1 pages with brand-compliant styling.
