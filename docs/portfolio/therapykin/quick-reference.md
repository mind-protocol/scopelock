## Technical Highlights (Copy-Paste Ready)

**Consumer AI Product:**
Built production B2C therapeutic companion with persistent memory architecture, multi-modal interaction (text + voice with seamless switching), evidence-based therapeutic approaches (CBT, DBT, ACT), and HIPAA-aware privacy design — live at therapykin.ai with 121+ Vercel deployments over 8+ months.

**Next.js/TypeScript Frontend:**
Modern React-based architecture with Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript for type safety, Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens, server-side rendering for fast initial loads, and component-based UI — achieving Lighthouse ≥90 scores with responsive design and dark mode support.

**Privacy-First Architecture:**
HIPAA-aware design with end-to-end encryption for conversation data, GDPR/CCPA compliance (export/delete capabilities), user-controlled data retention, anonymous account options, and transparent privacy policy — builds trust for sensitive therapeutic conversations.

**Multi-Modal Interaction:**
Flexible text/voice communication with ElevenLabs TTS integration, speech-to-text transcription, real-time typing indicators, and mid-conversation mode switching — users communicate however feels natural (voice while driving, text in quiet spaces).

**Rapid Production Iteration:**
121+ Vercel deployments demonstrating continuous improvement, automatic preview environments per PR, feature flags for gradual rollout, A/B testing for UX optimization, and fast bug fixes — rapid feedback loops from real user data.
