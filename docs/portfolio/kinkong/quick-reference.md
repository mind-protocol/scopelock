## Proof Points (Copy-Paste)

### For DeFi/Trading Projects

```
We built KinKong, an autonomous trading system managing $7M in Solana AI tokens. It executes 4x daily rebalancing cycles using Jupiter DEX for best price routing, with slippage protection (max 1%) and gas optimization. 229 production deployments prove high-stakes financial automation works.
```

### For AI + Blockchain Integration

```
KinKong uses specialized ML models to analyze on-chain data, social sentiment, and technical indicators for AI token trading. It detects market regime changes and adjusts portfolio allocation dynamically (70/20/10 in bull markets, 50/30/20 in bear). Real capital at risk, not paper trading.
```

### For Real-Time Data Processing

```
KinKong processes on-chain metrics, social signals, and technical indicators in real-time to generate trading signals every 6 hours. The system combines weighted signals using gradient boosting, with backtested weights optimized for Sharpe ratio. Adaptive recalibration responds to regime changes.
```

### For Community-Governed Products

```
KinKong includes community governance where users suggest AI tokens and vote weighted by $COMPUTE holdings. All trades are publicly logged for transparency. 229 deployments show we can build trust through evidence, not promises.
```

### For Browser Extensions / Chrome Extensions

```
We built KinKong Copilot, a Chrome extension (JavaScript 70.7%) that brings AI trading insights directly into the browser. Users get real-time portfolio monitoring, market sentiment analysis, and a trading journal with screenshot + voice note capture - all without leaving their current tab. Context-aware insights that know what page you're viewing.

## Stack Mentions

**For technical depth:**
```
Python (76.8%) for core trading engine, signal generation, portfolio optimization (Kelly criterion, mean-variance), and risk management. TypeScript (21.7%) for Next.js dashboard with real-time WebSocket feeds and governance UI. Solana integration via Jupiter aggregator SDK and Web3.js.
```

**For performance:**
```
4x daily rebalancing (every 6 hours), max 1% slippage protection, volatility-adjusted position sizing, max 15% single-token exposure, dynamic regime detection (GARCH models + ADX).
```

## Evidence Sprint Examples

### Trading Signal Module
```
We can build a working signal generation module that analyzes [your data source] and outputs trade recommendations with confidence scores. Demo: live dashboard showing signal history + hypothetical P&L over 30 days. 7-day delivery, $4,500.
```

### Portfolio Rebalancing System
```
Working prototype with paper trading + backtested strategy on your target assets. Demo: 30-day simulated performance with Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, and win rate metrics. 10-day delivery, $6,000.
```

### DEX Integration
```
Proof-of-concept connecting to [your target DEX] with best price routing, slippage protection, and gas optimization. Demo: 10 test swaps executed with cost comparison vs naive routing. 5-day delivery, $3,500.
```

## When to Reference

**Strong signal in job post:**
- Keywords: DeFi, trading, algorithmic trading, portfolio management, Solana, Jupiter, DEX, rebalancing, Chrome extension, browser extension
- Mentions: on-chain data, social sentiment analysis, risk management, automated trading, trading tools, market analysis tools
- Client persona: crypto fund, DeFi protocol, trading platform, blockchain analytics, fintech tools, trading SaaS

**Weak signal (don't force):**
- Generic "blockchain" without trading/DeFi specifics
- Ethereum-only (we're Solana-specialized)
- Manual trading tools (we're autonomous)
- NFT projects (wrong asset class)
