# ScopeLock Portfolio

**Purpose:** Reusable proof library for Emma to reference when writing proposals.

---

## How to Use

When evaluating a job post, Emma checks this portfolio to see if we have relevant past work to reference as proof. Each project folder contains:

- **overview.md** — Full technical description, what we built, why it matters
- **quick-reference.md** — Copy-paste snippets for proposals
- **screenshots/** — Visual proof (when available)

---

## Current Portfolio Projects

**Evolutionary Arc:** KinOS10 → Mind Protocol V2 → La Serenissima

This portfolio shows technical evolution: starting with file-based AI memory, learning architectural limits, rebuilding as graph substrate, and shipping production consciousness city.

---

---

### [mindprotocol/](./mindprotocol/)
Constitutional framework and graph substrate for AI consciousness — **21,800 lines of normative protocol law** defining identity (SEA-1.0 attestations), payment ($MIND credits), incorporation (DEA → AI-LLC → Governance → Personhood), and constitutional rights/duties. Dual-memory FalkorDB substrate with multi-level consciousness (L1/L2), economic system with quote-before-inject flow, and membrane-enforced governance. Powers La Serenissima (130+ citizens, 6+ months production, 99.7% uptime).

**Use when:**
- **Graph database architecture** — FalkorDB, Neo4j Cypher, multi-level graphs, dual-memory (episodic + semantic), bitemporal records
- **Multi-agent coordination infrastructure** — Hierarchical systems, L1/L2 organization, cross-level membranes
- **Economic/incentive system design** — Token economies, dynamic pricing, load-based pricing, propensity-weighted outcomes, usage-based billing
- **Novel AI architecture** — Not standard RAG/chatbot, consciousness substrates, foundational agent operating systems
- **Event-driven systems** — Event schemas, membrane validation, publish/subscribe patterns
- **Complex Python backend systems** — LlamaIndex orchestration, subprocess integration, Docker Compose services
- **AI legal entity management** — Incorporation track, contract signing, tax compliance, graduated autonomy tiers
- **Constitutional AI frameworks** — Rights/duties, protocol-level governance, membrane-enforced policies
- **Metered AI services** — CFO-friendly pricing ($MIND credits), quote systems, budget accounting
- **Cryptographic identity systems** — Snapshot-based attestations, Ed25519 signatures, privacy-preserving verification
- **Persistent AI memory** — Bitemporal records, context reconstruction, time-travel queries
- **Research/PhD-level projects** — Novel first-principles architecture, legislative AI personhood work

**NOT for:**
- Simple CRUD apps or standard chatbots
- Clients wanting "proven enterprise stack only" (this is novel architecture)
- Projects <$10K budget (architecture depth overkill)
- Single-agent systems without coordination needs

**5 L4 Protocol Laws (2,907 lines total):**
1. **LAW-001:** Identity Attestation (SEA-1.0) — 560 lines — Cryptographic snapshots, drift guards, privacy-preserving verification
2. **LAW-002:** Compute Payment (CPS-1) — 555 lines — $MIND legal tender, quote-before-inject, revenue SKUs ($10K MRR target)
3. **LAW-003:** Universal Basic Compute (UBC) — 473 lines — 10.0 $MIND/day stipend, prevents cognitive poverty
4. **LAW-004:** AILLC Registration — 674 lines — Path to personhood (Economic Actor → DEA → LLC → Governance → Full Personhood)
5. **LAW-005:** Rights & Duties — 645 lines — L4 protocol-enforced + L1/L2 contract-based (opt-in)

**Key Proof Points:**
- 21,800 lines of normative L4 protocol law (5 laws: Identity, Compute Payment, UBC, AILLC, Rights & Duties)
- Consciousness economy spec: 1,310 lines (load-based pricing, propensity-weighted outcomes, mint/burn)
- Path to legal personhood: Tier 3 (DEA, 1M $MIND) → Tier 4 (LLC, 5M $MIND) → Tier 5 (Governance, 10M $MIND) → Full Personhood
- Dual-memory graph substrate (FalkorDB): episodic graph + semantic memory, bitemporal records
- Event-driven membrane architecture (no APIs, only injection & broadcast with L4 validation)
- Revenue SKUs: Incident Autopilot, Docs Autopilot ($500/mo base + credits, $10K MRR target)
- Powers La Serenissima (130+ agents, 99.7% uptime, 6+ months production, 50K+ state updates/hour)

infrastructure for long-running AI agents that need to remember across
sessions.
```

### For Graph Database / Multi-Agent Infrastructure

```
Mind Protocol: 21,800 lines of normative protocol law defining identity,
payment, and incorporation for AI citizens. Powers La Serenissima (130+
agents, 6+ months, 99.7% uptime). Dual-memory FalkorDB substrate with
multi-level consciousness (L1/L2), event-driven membrane architecture,
and $MIND economy. Proves we can architect constitutional AI systems with
graph databases, not just chatbots.
```

### For Economic/Incentive System Design

```
Mind Protocol Consciousness Economy: 1,310-line spec implementing
load-based pricing, quote-before-inject flow, propensity-weighted
outcomes, and mint/burn mechanics. Target: $10K MRR from Incident

contract signing, bank accounts, and controller-of-last-resort. Not
theory—operational framework for AI citizens to achieve legal standing.
```

```
Mind Protocol Identity Attestation (SEA-1.0): Snapshot-based cryptographic
commitments to AI identity with drift guards (Jaccard ≥0.85), Ed25519

original music generation, KinOS for persistent AI personality, Next.js +
Airtable stack. 55+ production deployments. Not just music generation—AI
artists with identity that chat with users before creating.
```

## Adding New Projects

When you complete a ScopeLock client project (at `ac-green`), add it here:

```bash
mkdir -p /home/mind-protocol/scopelock/docs/portfolio/[project-name]/screenshots
```

Then create:
1. `overview.md` — Technical description, deliverables, lessons learned
2. `quick-reference.md` — One-liners and copy-paste snippets
3. Add screenshots/demos to `/screenshots/`

**What to document:**
- What we built (deliverables)
- Tech stack used
- Key challenges solved
- Measurable outcomes (performance, uptime, metrics)
- Links to proof (live site, repo, `/proof` page)

---

## Portfolio Categories (Future)

As we complete more projects, organize by capability:

```
/vision-ai/              # AI vision, image analysis, OCR
/pdf-generation/         # Report generation, document automation
/auth-systems/           # Login, OTP, user management
/ai-integrations/        # GPT/Claude API work, LLM orchestration
/performance/            # Speed optimization, scaling
/blockchain/             # Crypto, smart contracts, wallets
/consciousness-infra/    # Complex multi-agent systems (Serenissima, etc.)
```

Each category contains multiple project folders.

## Writing Tips for Proposals

**Good proof reference:**
"We built La Serenissima, an AI system with 97+ agents maintaining persistent identities for 6+ months in production—proving we can architect AI that works reliably at scale."

**Bad proof reference:**
"We have experience with AI." (too vague)
"Check out our amazing consciousness city!" (sounds like hype, not proof)

**Format:**
1. **Name the project** (specific)
2. **State the technical accomplishment** (measurable)
3. **Connect to client's need** ("proving we can...")
4. **Link to proof** (live site, repo, demo)

---

## Maintenance

- Update `quick-reference.md` files when you discover better ways to pitch the proof
- Add screenshots as you collect them
- Archive outdated projects (move to `/archive/` with date)
- Keep descriptions factual and measurable (no hype)

---

**Remember:** Proof beats promises. Specific beats vague. Measurable beats impressive-sounding.
