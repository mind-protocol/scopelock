# ScopeLock Portfolio

**Purpose:** Reusable proof library for Emma to reference when writing proposals.

---

## How to Use

When evaluating a job post, Emma checks this portfolio to see if we have relevant past work to reference as proof. Each project folder contains:

- **overview.md** — Full technical description, what we built, why it matters
- **quick-reference.md** — Copy-paste snippets for proposals
- **screenshots/** — Visual proof (when available)

## Quick-Reference Snippets for Proposals

Copy-paste these into proposals based on project relevance:

### For Vision AI / Image Analysis Projects

```
We built DuoAI (duoai.vercel.app), a gaming companion that integrates Claude
vision API for real-time screen analysis. That same vision integration
capability applies directly to [their use case]: upload image, send to
Claude/GPT-4o vision with structured prompt, parse JSON response, generate
output. We know how to make vision APIs reliable in production, not just
prototypes.
```

### For Multi-Agent / Complex AI Systems

```
We built La Serenissima (serenissima.ai), an AI system with 130+ persistent
agents running for 6+ months in production (50,000+ state updates/hour). We
know how to ship complex AI systems that don't just demo well—they run
reliably under load.
```

### For Trading / DeFi / Financial Systems

```
KinKong (konginvest.ai): Autonomous trading bot managing $7M capital, 4x
daily rebalancing, Solana DEX integration. Proves we can build real-time
financial systems with actual capital at risk, not just prototypes.
```

### For Consumer AI / Therapy / Wellness Apps

```
TherapyKin (therapykin.ai): AI therapeutic companion with HIPAA-aware
privacy, multi-modal interaction (text + voice), 121+ production
deployments. Proves we can handle sensitive data and complex user journeys.
```

### For Open-Source Credibility / Multi-Agent Orchestration

```
Terminal Velocity (github.com/mind-protocol/terminal-velocity): 1.1k GitHub
stars, 526-page novel on Amazon created by 13 autonomous AI agents. Top
0.01% of GitHub projects. Proves we can orchestrate complex multi-agent
systems that produce real results.
```

### For AI Memory / Context Management Systems

```
KinOS (github.com/mind-protocol/kinos10): Adaptive context management system
with persistent AI memory and multi-LLM orchestration. Built as
infrastructure for long-running AI agents that need to remember across
sessions.
```

### For Chrome Extensions / Browser Tools

```
KinKong Copilot (github.com/mind-protocol/kinkong-copilot): Chrome extension
trading companion with real-time analytics. Proves we can build polished
browser extensions with complex data integrations.
```

## Adding New Projects

When you complete a ScopeLock client project (at `ac-green`), add it here:

```bash
mkdir -p /home/mind-protocol/scopelock/docs/portfolio/[project-name]/screenshots
```

Then create:
1. `overview.md` — Technical description, deliverables, lessons learned
2. `quick-reference.md` — One-liners and copy-paste snippets
3. Add screenshots/demos to `/screenshots/`

**What to document:**
- What we built (deliverables)
- Tech stack used
- Key challenges solved
- Measurable outcomes (performance, uptime, metrics)
- Links to proof (live site, repo, `/proof` page)

---

## Portfolio Categories (Future)

As we complete more projects, organize by capability:

```
/vision-ai/              # AI vision, image analysis, OCR
/pdf-generation/         # Report generation, document automation
/auth-systems/           # Login, OTP, user management
/ai-integrations/        # GPT/Claude API work, LLM orchestration
/performance/            # Speed optimization, scaling
/blockchain/             # Crypto, smart contracts, wallets
/consciousness-infra/    # Complex multi-agent systems (Serenissima, etc.)
```

Each category contains multiple project folders.

## Writing Tips for Proposals

**Good proof reference:**
"We built La Serenissima, an AI system with 97+ agents maintaining persistent identities for 6+ months in production—proving we can architect AI that works reliably at scale."

**Bad proof reference:**
"We have experience with AI." (too vague)
"Check out our amazing consciousness city!" (sounds like hype, not proof)

**Format:**
1. **Name the project** (specific)
2. **State the technical accomplishment** (measurable)
3. **Connect to client's need** ("proving we can...")
4. **Link to proof** (live site, repo, demo)

---

## Maintenance

- Update `quick-reference.md` files when you discover better ways to pitch the proof
- Add screenshots as you collect them
- Archive outdated projects (move to `/archive/` with date)
- Keep descriptions factual and measurable (no hype)

---

**Remember:** Proof beats promises. Specific beats vague. Measurable beats impressive-sounding.
