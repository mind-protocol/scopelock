## Why This Matters

You're joining a team where **AI does 95% of the heavy lifting** and you supervise, deploy, and verify. But if you don't know:
- **WHO** to ask when stuck
- **WHEN** to escalate vs. continue
- **WHAT** a good handoff looks like

...you'll waste hours in confusion instead of shipping fast.

**This guide shows the complete flow** from "job posted on Upwork" to "client paid, testimonial received."

```

**Key insight:** Each phase has a **clear owner**, **AI support**, and **handoff criteria**.

---

## Phase 1: ACQUIRE (~2 minutes)

### Owner: Bigbosexf ("The Hunter")
### AI Support: Emma ("The Scout")

### The Flow

**Step 1: Search & Filter (Bigbosexf)**
1. Open Upwork, search for jobs matching our criteria
2. Copy entire results page
3. Paste to Emma (via Claude Code): `"Emma, analyze these jobs"`

**Step 2: Emma's Analysis (AI, instant)**
- Emma reads all job posts
- Returns: `"3 NO-GO (reasons), 2 STRONG GO (confidence scores)"`
- Provides brief rationale for each decision

**Step 3: Deep Dive (Bigbosexf)**
- Open each STRONG GO job
- Copy ENTIRE job description (don't summarize!)
- Paste to Emma: `"Emma, write proposal for this job"`

**Step 4: Emma Generates Complete Proposal Package (AI, ~60 seconds)**
Emma produces:
- ✅ Full proposal text (plain text, ready to paste)
- ✅ Answers to client questions
- ✅ Metadata JSON (budget, timeline, client info)
- ✅ Telegram notification to team

**Step 5: Send (Bigbosexf)**
- Review Emma's proposal (30 seconds)
- Copy-paste into Upwork
- Submit!

### Duration: ~2 minutes per proposal

### What You Receive (As Bigbosexf)

📱 **Telegram notification:**
```
🎯 STRONG GO • UPWORK • 90% confidence

Landing Page for SaaS Product

💰 $400-600 (bid: $500)
👤 $12,500 spent • 4.9★ • 15 hires • ✅ verified
📁 Proof: TherapyKin
🎭 Type: process-skeptical

PROPOSAL:

🔗 [Job URL]
```

📄 **Files created:**
- `/citizens/emma/proposals/2025-11-05_upwork_saas-landing-page.txt`
- `/citizens/emma/proposals/2025-11-05_upwork_saas-landing-page.json`

### When to Escalate
- ❌ **DON'T escalate:** Emma says NO-GO → Trust her, move on
- ✅ **DO escalate:** Client responds with technical question you can't answer → Telegram NLR

---

## Phase 2: SPECIFY (Duration: PLACEHOLDER - Details TBD)

### Owner: Reanance ("The Specifier")
### AI Support: Inna ("The Specifier")

### The Flow

**[PLACEHOLDER - Multi-step process being documented]**

This phase involves:
1. Client onboarding (with Maya's guidance)
2. Requirements gathering
3. Writing complete specifications with Inna (6 levels: PATTERN → BEHAVIOR_SPEC → VALIDATION → MECHANISM → ALGORITHM → GUIDE)
4. Locking scope via AC.md baseline
5. Creating DoD (Definition of Done) checklist

### What Gets Produced
- ✅ AC.md (Acceptance Criteria)
- ✅ DoD checklist
- ✅ Architecture notes
- ✅ Deployment guide
- ✅ Test plan

### When to Escalate
- ✅ **DO escalate:** Client unclear on requirements → Telegram NLR
- ✅ **DO escalate:** Client requests change and you don't know if it's Swap or Add → Telegram NLR

---

## Phase 3: BUILD (2 days simple, 5 days complex)

### Owner: Kara ("The Builder")
### AI Support: Rafael ("The Guide")

### The Flow

**Step 1: Read Specs (Kara, 30 min)**
- Read Reanance's complete specs
- Check AC.md (what must work)
- Check DoD checklist (how we verify it works)
- Review architecture notes
- Check deployment guide

**Step 2: Generate Code (Rafael, AI, instant)**

Kara asks Rafael via Claude Code:
```
"Rafael, generate implementation for Mission #47 per Reanance's specs at
/path/to/specs/AC.md"
```

Rafael returns:
- ✅ Complete file structure
- ✅ All code files
- ✅ Dependencies (package.json, requirements.txt)
- ✅ Configuration (.env.example)
- ✅ Deployment instructions

**Step 3: Review & Test Locally (Kara, 2-4 hours)**
- Create project from Rafael's code
- Install dependencies
- Run locally
- Test against AC.md criteria
- Fix any obvious issues

**Step 4: Deploy (Kara, 1-2 hours)**
- Deploy to Vercel (frontend) or Render (backend)
- Configure environment variables
- Test deployed version
- Verify all AC.md criteria pass on production

**Step 5: Update SYNC.md (Kara)**
```markdown
## 2025-11-05 14:30 - Kara: Mission #47 Deployed

**Status:** Deployed to production, ready for QA
**URL:** https://client-project.vercel.app
**What works:** All 5 AC.md criteria tested and passing
**Next:** Bigbosexf QA testing
**Link:** /citizens/kara/missions/047-saas-landing/
```

### Duration
- **Simple (landing page, bot):** 2 days
- **Medium (CRUD dashboard, API integration):** 3-4 days
- **Complex (multi-feature app):** 5 days

### When to Escalate

**If stuck >1 hour:**
1. Try asking Rafael first: `"Rafael, I'm getting this error: [paste error]. I tried [X]. What should I do?"`
2. If still stuck after Rafael's guidance → **Telegram NLR** (include error, what you tried, Rafael's suggestion)
3. If truly urgent/blocking → **Call NLR**

**Common issues Rafael can fix:**
- ✅ Deployment errors
- ✅ Environment variable configuration
- ✅ API integration issues
- ✅ Database connection problems
- ✅ Build failures

---

## Phase 4: TEST (2-4 hours)

### Owner: Bigbosexf ("The Hunter" + QA)
### AI Support: Sofia ("The Checker")

### The Flow

**Step 1: Receive Handoff (Bigbosexf)**

Kara updates SYNC.md → Bigbosexf sees notification

**Step 2: Get QA Checklist (Bigbosexf + Sofia)**

Ask Sofia via Claude Code:
```
"Sofia, verify Mission #47 ready for delivery. Specs at
/path/to/specs/AC.md"
```

Sofia returns:
- ✅ DoD checklist from Reanance's specs
- ✅ AC.md criteria to verify
- ✅ Performance thresholds to check
- ✅ Test URLs and credentials

**Step 3: Manual Testing (Bigbosexf, 1-2 hours)**
- Test every AC.md criterion
- Try to break it (edge cases)
- Check mobile responsiveness
- Verify performance (fast enough?)
- Test error handling

**Step 4: Document Findings**

**If bugs found:**
- Screenshot the bug
- Write clear reproduction steps
- Update SYNC.md with findings
- **Talk directly to Kara** (not NLR, not Rafael)

**If all passes:**
- Update SYNC.md: "QA passed ✅"
- Screenshot proof of working features
- Sign off DoD checklist

### Duration: 2-4 hours
- Simple: 2 hours
- Complex: 4 hours

### Bug Fix Loop

```
Bigbosexf finds bug
    ↓
Talks to Kara (in-person or Telegram)
    ↓
Kara fixes (with Rafael's help if needed)
    ↓
Kara deploys fix
    ↓
Bigbosexf re-tests ONLY the fixed part
    ↓
If still broken: repeat
If fixed: continue QA
```

### When to Escalate
- ❌ **DON'T escalate:** Bug found → Talk to Kara directly
- ✅ **DO escalate:** Bug is critical AND Kara can't fix in 2 hours → Telegram NLR

---

## Phase 5: DELIVER (~1 day)

### Owner: Reanance ("The Specifier")
### AI Support: Maya ("The Bridge")

### The Flow

**Step 1: Prepare Delivery Package (Reanance + Maya)**

Ask Maya:
```
"Maya, create delivery presentation for Mission #47 client. Demo URL:
[URL]. AC.md at [path]."
```

Maya provides:
- ✅ Demo script (what to show, in what order)
- ✅ Key deltas to highlight (before/after)
- ✅ Handoff documentation template
- ✅ Post-delivery check-in message template

**Step 2: Present to Client (Reanance, 30 min call)**
- Show demo (following Maya's script)
- Highlight quantified deltas
- Provide credentials + documentation
- Explain support plan

**Step 3: NLR Final Review (NLR, 15 min)**
- Check SYNC.md status
- Verify QA passed
- Quick visual check of deployed site
- Approve delivery ✅

**Step 4: Client Accepts**
- [PLACEHOLDER: Payment flow details TBD]
- [PLACEHOLDER: Team payment distribution TBD]

**Step 5: Post-Delivery Check-in (Reanance + Maya, 1 week later)**

Maya provides message template:
```
Hi [Client Name],

It's been a week since we delivered [Project Name]. Quick check-in:

1. How's everything working?
2. Any questions or issues?
3. If you're happy with the work, would you be open to providing a brief
   testimonial?

[Name]
```

### Duration: ~1 day (including waiting for client response)

### When to Escalate
- ✅ **DO escalate:** Client unhappy/requests major changes → Telegram NLR immediately
- ✅ **DO escalate:** Client requests scope change → Reanance decides Swap/Add (unless unsure, then ask NLR)

---

## SYNC.md Update Triggers

Update SYNC.md **after any significant event**, not daily. "Significant" means:

✅ **DO update:**
- Proposal sent
- Job won
- Specs completed
- Deployment live
- Bug found in QA
- Bug fixed
- QA passed
- Client presented
- Client accepted
- Payment received
- **Blocked >1 hour**

❌ **DON'T update:**
- "Still working on it" (unless blocked)
- Minor progress updates
- Daily check-ins

**Rule:** Every 1-2 meaningful messages, update SYNC.md

---

## Decision Points Reference

### "Who do I ask?"

| Situation | Ask | Why |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Stuck on code error <1 hour | Rafael (AI) | He debugs instantly |
| Stuck on code error >1 hour | NLR (Telegram/Call) | Need human guidance |
| Bug found in QA | Kara directly | She's the implementer |
| Client question (technical) | Rafael or NLR | Depends on complexity |
| Client question (scope/timeline) | Reanance handles (with Maya's help) | Reanance owns client relationship |
| Client requests change | Reanance decides Swap/Add | Unless unclear, then NLR |
| Should I take this job? | Emma (AI) | She evaluates fit |
| How should I price this? | Alexis (AI) | She guides pricing strategy |
| How do I write specs? | Inna (AI) | She generates complete docs |
| Is this ready for delivery? | Sofia (AI) | She verifies DoD |

## Common Failure Modes & How to Avoid

### Failure Mode 1: "I Don't Know What to Do Next"
**Symptom:** Finished a phase, not sure who to hand off to
**Fix:** Check the phase diagram at top → See next phase owner → Update SYNC.md with handoff

### Failure Mode 2: "I'm Stuck and Wasting Time"
**Symptom:** Been stuck >1 hour, haven't asked for help
**Fix:**
1. Try Rafael first (ask specific question with error/context)
2. Still stuck after 30 min? → Telegram NLR
3. Urgent? → Call NLR

### Failure Mode 3: "Client Changed Requirements Mid-Mission"
**Symptom:** Client wants something different from AC.md
**Fix:**
1. Reanance decides: is this Swap (equal/lower complexity, €0) or Add (new milestone, priced)?
2. If Swap: Update AC.md, continue
3. If Add: Create new milestone, get client approval, schedule separately
4. If unsure which: Telegram NLR

### Failure Mode 4: "QA Found Critical Bug Right Before Delivery"
**Symptom:** Bug breaks core functionality, delivery is tomorrow
**Fix:**
1. Bigbosexf talks to Kara immediately (don't wait)
2. Kara asks Rafael for fix
3. If fixable in <2 hours: fix, re-test, deliver
4. If not fixable quickly: Telegram NLR + postpone delivery 1 day

## Quiz: Test Your Understanding

**Scenario 1:** You're Kara. You deployed the app but get a weird error you've never seen. You've been stuck for 45 minutes. What do you do?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct action:**
1. Ask Rafael with specific context: "Rafael, I'm getting this error: [paste error]. I tried [X and Y]. What should I do?"
2. If Rafael's solution doesn't work after 30 min → Telegram NLR with: error, what you tried, Rafael's suggestion

**Why:** Rafael can debug most issues instantly. Only escalate to NLR if Rafael can't solve it.
</details>

---

**Scenario 2:** You're Bigbosexf doing QA. You find a bug where the contact form doesn't send emails. What do you do?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct action:**
1. Screenshot the bug
2. Write reproduction steps
3. Talk directly to Kara (don't go through NLR or Rafael first)
4. Kara will fix (with Rafael's help if needed)
5. Kara will let you know when to re-test

**Why:** Kara is the implementer. She owns the fix. Going through NLR wastes time.
</details>

---

**Scenario 3:** You're Reanance. Mid-implementation, the client says "Can we also add a blog section?" What do you do?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Correct action:**
1. Check AC.md: Is "blog section" in scope?
2. If NO → This is a change request
3. Decide: Is this Swap (replace something with blog, same complexity) or Add (new milestone)?
4. If SWAP: Update AC.md, tell Kara, continue
5. If ADD: Create new milestone, price it, get client approval before scheduling
6. If you're unsure which → Telegram NLR for guidance

**Why:** Reanance owns scope decisions. But if unclear, NLR helps decide.
</details>
