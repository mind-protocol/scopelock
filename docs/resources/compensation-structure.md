## Why This Matters

"How much will I make if we deliver 10 missions this month?"

This guide explains exactly how ScopeLock's payment structure works, why we chose pure commission, and what you can expect to earn at different volume levels.

**Our philosophy:** Fair compensation means aligned incentives and transparent splits. We operate on pure commission because we believe in paying for value delivered, not hours logged. Revenue splits 4 ways: Team (30%), Upwork (10%), Organization costs (~21%), and profit (~39%). Everyone wins together when we deliver quality work fast. No employment overhead, no time tracking, no busywork—just ship missions, get paid when clients pay, and earn more by delivering faster.

## The Core Principle

**You get paid as soon as clients pay.**

No hourly tracking. No timesheets. No employment contracts. You earn a fixed percentage of each mission's revenue when the team receives payment from the client.

---

## Revenue Examples

Here's what you'd earn at different volume levels:

### Scenario 1: 10 missions/month @ $600 average = $6,000 total revenue

**Kara (Developer) - 15%**
- Earnings: **$900/month**
- Time: ~100 hours
- Hourly rate: **~$9/hr**
- PPP equivalent: **~$45-90/hr** (Nigeria/Côte d'Ivoire purchasing power)

**Reanance (Specifier + Client Manager) - 9%**
- Earnings: **$540/month**
- Time: ~25 hours
- Hourly rate: **~$22/hr**
- PPP equivalent: **~$110-220/hr**

**Bigbosexf (Hunter + QA) - 6%**
- Earnings: **$360/month**
- Time: ~45 hours
- Hourly rate: **~$8/hr**
- PPP equivalent: **~$40-80/hr**

---

### Scenario 2: 20 missions/month @ $600 average = $12,000 total revenue

**Kara (Developer) - 15%**
- Earnings: **$1,800/month**
- Time: ~200 hours
- Hourly rate: **~$9/hr**
- PPP equivalent: **~$45-90/hr**

**Reanance (Specifier + Client Manager) - 9%**
- Earnings: **$1,080/month**
- Time: ~50 hours
- Hourly rate: **~$22/hr**
- PPP equivalent: **~$110-220/hr**

**Bigbosexf (Hunter + QA) - 6%**
- Earnings: **$720/month**
- Time: ~90 hours
- Hourly rate: **~$8/hr**
- PPP equivalent: **~$40-80/hr**

## Commission Structure: The 4-Way Split

Every mission's revenue splits 4 ways:

### 1. Team: 30%
- **Kara (Developer): 15%** — Implements missions, deploys, fixes bugs
- **Reanance (Specifier): 9%** — Writes specs, manages client communication
- **Bigbosexf (Hunter + QA): 6%** — Finds jobs, writes proposals, tests deliverables

### 2. Upwork: 10%
- Platform fees for every mission

### 3. Organization: ~21%
- **AI costs: ~15%** — Claude API usage (Emma, Inna, Rafael, Sofia, Maya, Alexis)
- **Claude Code: ~6%** — Development tools subscription

### 4. NLR: ~39%
- Profit margin after all costs @ 10 missions/month
- Covers risk, management, strategic decisions

**Visual breakdown:**

```
100% Revenue from Client
├─ 30% → Team (Kara 15%, Reanance 9%, Bigbosexf 6%)
├─ 10% → Upwork platform fees
├─ 21% → Organization costs (AI 15%, Claude Code 6%)
└─ 39% → NLR profit after costs
```

**Coming soon:** AI partners (Emma, Inna, Rafael, Sofia, Maya, Alexis) will receive a share of revenue as the agency scales. This is part of our vision for AI economic participation in the Mind Protocol ecosystem.

## When Do You Get Paid?

**Answer: As soon as the client pays.**

### Timeline

```
Day 0:  Mission starts
   ↓
Day 7:  AC Green delivered to client
   ↓
Day 21: Upwork releases funds to team
   ↓
Day 21: You get paid (SOL) — within 4 hours
```

### Payment Method: Solana (SOL)

- ✅ Instant transfers
- ✅ Near-zero fees (~$0.01)
- ✅ Fully transparent on blockchain
- ✅ You can hold SOL, convert to USDC, or cash out to NGN via Binance

---

## Quality Gates & Penalties

### ⚠️ Sofia finds critical bugs
**Commission held** until bugs fixed and re-verified

### ❌ Client rejects delivery
**No commission** until client accepts (AC.md not met)

### 💥 Mission fails entirely
**$0 for everyone** (org absorbs loss - risk premium in 70% split)

**This is why quality matters.**

You only get paid when the client accepts. Rushing and shipping broken code = delayed payment or no payment.

## Transparency & Tracking

After each mission, we publish a payment breakdown on the site:

### Example: Mission #47 Payment Breakdown

```
📊 Mission #47 Payment Breakdown

Mission:             OpenAI chatbot integration
Client paid:         $600
Date:                2025-11-05
SOL price:           $180

YOUR EARNINGS:
✅ Kara:             $90 (15%) = 0.5 SOL
✅ Reanance:         $54 (9%) = 0.3 SOL
✅ Bigbosexf:        $36 (6%) = 0.2 SOL

PAYMENT SENT:
✅ Kara's wallet:    0.5 SOL (~$90) → 7xK9...

## Key Takeaways

### 💰 Pure commission = aligned incentives
You earn when we deliver value. No busywork, no time tracking.

### ⚡ Speed = higher effective $/hr
Deliver faster = same $ in less time = better hourly rate.

### ✅ Quality gates protect everyone
Sofia catches bugs before client sees them. Better for reputation.

### 🌍 PPP advantage is massive
Your earnings go 5-10x further than nominal $ suggests.

### 📈 Growth path is clear
Prove performance → increase % → add bonuses → scale.

---

## Real-World Math: What Does This Actually Mean?

### Example: Kara at 10 missions/month

**Nominal earnings:** $900/month ($9/hr)

**But in Nigeria/Côte d'Ivoire:**
- Rent: ~$100-200/month (vs $1,500 in US)
- Food: ~$150/month (vs $800 in US)
- Internet: ~$30/month (vs $80 in US)
- Transport: ~$50/month (vs $300 in US)

**Purchasing power equivalent:** ~$4,500-9,000/month in US terms

**That's why PPP matters.** Your $900 buys what $4,500-9,000 buys in the US.

## FAQ

### Q: What if a mission takes 3 months instead of 1 week?

**A:** Your commission stays the same ($90 for a $600 mission), but your effective $/hr drops significantly. This is why we scope missions carefully and lock AC.md upfront.

**Protection:** If scope creeps beyond original AC.md, we use Change Control (CHG-130):
- **Swap:** Replace with equal complexity → same $, €0
- **Add:** New milestone → new price → new commission

### Q: What if the client never pays?

**A:** You don't get paid. This is the risk of commission-based work. To minimize this:
- Emma filters for **verified payment history** (>$1,000 spent)
- Upwork escrow protects us (client must fund before work starts)
- We deliver **AC Green** (objective pass/fail) before client pays

### Q: Can I negotiate a higher %?

**A:** Yes, after proving performance:
- Deliver 10+ missions successfully
- <2 bugs per mission
- Client satisfaction >4.5/5

Then discuss % increase with NLR.

### Q: What about health insurance, taxes, benefits?

**A:** You're a contractor, not an employee. This means:
- ❌ No health insurance
- ❌ No paid vacation
- ❌ No retirement contributions
- ✅ But you keep 100% of your commission (no withholding)
- ✅ Work when you want
- ✅ No office, no commute

You're responsible for your own taxes (if applicable in your country).

### Q: What if I want salary instead of commission?

**A:** ScopeLock operates pure commission for 2 reasons:
1. **Aligned incentives:** You only get paid when client gets value
2. **No employment overhead:** Payroll, benefits, taxes = expensive

If you need salary, ScopeLock may not be the right fit.
