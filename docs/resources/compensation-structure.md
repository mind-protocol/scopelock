## Why This Is Cool

**The more you work, the more you earn. And you know exactly how much.**

Most agencies pay fixed salaries or hourly rates. You work hard on a project, but your teammate slacks off—you both get paid the same. That's not fair.

**ScopeLock is different:**
- Every time you send a message to an AI (Rafael, Inna, Sofia, Emma) from Mission Deck, you earn +1 interaction point
- Your share of the job: `(Your interactions / Total team interactions) × 30% of job value`
- **Real-time visibility:** You see your potential earnings update live as you work
- **100% fair:** More contribution = more money. Less contribution = less money.

**Example:**
```
Upwork Job: $1,000
Team pool: $300 (30%)

You: 20 interactions
Teammate: 10 interactions
Total: 30 interactions

Your earnings: (20/30) × $300 = $200
Teammate earnings: (10/30) × $300 = $100

You worked 2x as hard → you earn 2x as much. Fair.
```

## Why This Matters

**"How much will I make if I contribute to 10 missions this month?"**

It depends on how much you contribute. If you're very active (lots of messages to AIs), you'll earn more than someone who contributes less. This guide explains exactly how the new system works.

**Our philosophy:** Fair compensation means rewarding actual contribution, not arbitrary roles. Work more → earn more. Work less → earn less. Everyone sees everyone's contribution in real-time. No surprises, no politics, no favoritism.

---

## The New System: Per-Interaction Compensation

### How It Works

**Step 1:** Every message you send to an AI from Mission Deck earns you +1 interaction point for that job.

**Step 2:** When the job completes and the client pays, the 30% team pool is split based on interaction counts:

```
Your share = (Your interactions / Total team interactions) × 30% of job value
```

**Step 3:** You get paid when we receive money from the client (typically 21 days after delivery).

### What Counts as an Interaction

✅ **Counts:**
- Sending a message to Rafael (code generation requests)
- Sending a message to Inna (specification questions)
- Sending a message to Sofia (QA requests)
- Sending a message to Emma (proposal assistance)

❌ **Does NOT count (for now):**
- File uploads
- Deployments
- Testing actions
- Messages outside Mission Deck

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Equal Contribution

**Job:** Build chatbot for Client ($1,000)
**Team pool:** $300 (30%)

**Interactions:**
- You: 15 messages to AIs
- Teammate A: 15 messages to AIs
- Teammate B: 15 messages to AIs
- Total: 45 interactions

**Earnings:**
- You: (15/45) × $300 = **$100**
- Teammate A: (15/45) × $300 = **$100**
- Teammate B: (15/45) × $300 = **$100**

Everyone contributed equally → everyone earns equally.

---

### Example 2: You Work Harder

**Job:** Build chatbot for Client ($1,000)
**Team pool:** $300 (30%)

**Interactions:**
- You: 30 messages to AIs (you drove the project)
- Teammate A: 10 messages to AIs
- Teammate B: 5 messages to AIs
- Total: 45 interactions

**Earnings:**
- You: (30/45) × $300 = **$200**
- Teammate A: (10/45) × $300 = **$67**
- Teammate B: (5/45) × $300 = **$33**

You worked 3x harder than Teammate A → you earn 3x as much. **Fair.**

---

### Example 3: Multiple Jobs Per Month

**Month:** 10 jobs @ $1,000 average = $10,000 total revenue
**Total team pool:** $3,000 (30% × $10,000)

**Your total interactions across all 10 jobs:** 200
**Total team interactions across all 10 jobs:** 400

**Your monthly earnings:** (200/400) × $3,000 = **$1,500**

You contributed 50% of the team's work → you earn 50% of the team pool.

---

## Missions: Fixed-Price Internal Work

Not all work is tied to Upwork jobs. Some work is internal (proposals, recruitment, social posts). These are called **Missions** and have fixed prices:

### Mission Pricing

- **Write Upwork proposal:** $1 per proposal
- **Recruit new team member:** $10 per successful hire
- **Post about ScopeLock on X:** $2 per post

**How missions are funded:** 5% of every job's value goes into a "mission fund" that pays for these internal tasks.

**Example:**
```
Job: $1,000
Mission fund: $50 (5%)

This $50 pays for:
- 5 proposals written ($5)
- 1 recruitment ($10)
- 10 X posts ($20)
Total spent: $35
Remaining: $15 (rolls over to next job)
```

---

## Total Compensation Breakdown Per Job

**When a $1,000 Upwork job completes:**

```
100% Client Payment: $1,000
├─ 30% → Team Pool ($300) — split by interactions
├─ 5% → Mission Fund ($50) — pays for missions
├─ 10% → Upwork fees ($100)
├─ ~21% → AI costs ($210) — Claude API, tools
└─ ~34% → ScopeLock profit ($340)
```

**You earn from:**
1. **Team pool:** Your share of the 30% based on interactions
2. **Missions completed:** Fixed $ per mission (funded from 5% mission fund)

## When Do You Get Paid?

**Answer: When we receive payment from the client.**

### Timeline

```
Day 0:  Job starts
   ↓
Day 7:  AC Green delivered to client
   ↓
Day 21: Upwork releases funds to ScopeLock
   ↓
Day 21: You get paid (SOL) — within 4 hours
```

### Payment Method: Solana (SOL)

- ✅ Instant transfers
- ✅ Near-zero fees (~$0.01)
- ✅ Fully transparent on blockchain
- ✅ You can hold SOL, convert to USDC, or cash out to local currency via Binance

---

## Why This System Is Better

### Old System (Fixed Roles)
❌ Kara always gets 15%, even if he barely contributes
❌ Reanance always gets 9%, even if she works overtime
❌ Bigbosexf always gets 6%, even if he finds 20 jobs this month
❌ No incentive to contribute more
❌ Resentment builds when effort isn't rewarded

### New System (Per-Interaction)
✅ Work 2x as hard → earn 2x as much
✅ Real-time visibility into earnings
✅ 100% transparent (everyone sees everyone's contribution)
✅ Natural incentive to contribute more
✅ Fair distribution based on actual work

---

## Quality Gates & Penalties

### ⚠️ Sofia finds critical bugs
**Commission held** until bugs fixed and re-verified

### ❌ Client rejects delivery
**No commission** until client accepts (AC.md not met)

### 💥 Job fails entirely
**$0 for everyone** (ScopeLock absorbs loss)

**This is why quality matters.** You only get paid when the client accepts. Rushing and shipping broken code = delayed payment or no payment.

---

## Real-World Math: What Does This Actually Mean?

### Example: You contribute to 10 jobs in a month

**Assumptions:**
- Average job value: $800
- Your interactions: 50% of team total (you're very active)

**Calculation:**
```
Total revenue: 10 × $800 = $8,000
Team pool: $8,000 × 30% = $2,400

Your share (50% of interactions):
$2,400 × 50% = $1,200/month
```

**Plus missions:**
- 10 proposals written: $10
- 5 X posts: $10
- Total missions: $20

**Your total monthly earnings: $1,220**

**In local currency (Nigeria):**
- $1,220 × 1,650 NGN/USD = ₦2,013,000/month
- That's ~2x median software developer salary in Lagos

**Purchasing power equivalent:** ~$6,000-12,000/month in US terms

## FAQ

### Q: What if I'm slower than my teammates? Will I earn less?

**A:** Yes, if you contribute fewer interactions, you'll earn less from that job. **But that's fair.** The system rewards contribution, not speed alone. If you're slower but thorough, you might contribute more interactions (asking clarifying questions, requesting more tests, etc.) and still earn a good share.

### Q: What if someone spams messages to AIs just to get more interactions?

**A:** Sofia (QA) catches low-quality work before delivery. If your interactions don't contribute to the final quality, the job fails → everyone gets $0. You have a strong incentive to make quality contributions, not spam.

### Q: Can I see how much my teammates are earning?

**A:** Yes. Mission Deck shows everyone's interaction counts and earnings for each job. **This is deliberate.** Transparency prevents resentment and politics. Everyone knows exactly where they stand.

### Q: What if I disagree with my interaction count?

**A:** All interactions are automatically tracked by Mission Deck (blockchain-verifiable). There's no subjective judgment. If the system didn't count a message, it's because it wasn't sent from Mission Deck to an AI.

### Q: What about other work (deployments, testing, debugging)?

**A:** For now, only messages to AIs count. We chose this because it's objective, automated, and captures most of the work. As the system matures, we may add other interaction types (deployments, test runs, etc.) if they can be tracked automatically.
