# ScopeLock Mission Catalog - Acquisition & Growth

**Purpose:** Standalone missions team members can complete to earn compensation (separate from job-specific work)
**Context:** These are hunting/acquisition tasks, NOT tasks within client jobs
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-07

## Mission vs Job Work

**MISSIONS (this catalog):**
- Acquisition tasks (find clients, build network)
- Standalone, anyone can do anytime
- Earn compensation from mission pool

**JOB WORK (separate):**

## Mission Strategy

1. **Connect Telegram** ($50) ← Do this FIRST
2. **Find and propose 10 jobs** ($100) ← High volume hunting

4. **Total first week:** $200+ guaranteed, $700+ potential

**For Experienced Members (maximize bonuses):**
1. Focus on quality over quantity for team/client messages
2. Target warm leads (people who know your work)
3. Follow up on outreach (conversion = big bonuses)

**For Network-Rich Members:**
1. Connect Telegram immediately ($50)
2. Message entire relevant network (clients + team members)
3. Even 10% conversion = significant bonus income

---

## Mission Guidelines

**DO:**
- Log missions immediately with evidence
- Provide screenshots and timestamps
- Focus on quality (thoughtful messages, relevant jobs)
- Follow up on your outreach

**DON'T:**
- Spam contacts (quality > quantity)
- Submit proposals to jobs we can't deliver
- Log fake missions (verified via screenshots)
- Share sensitive client info in logs

---

## Verification Process

**All missions require evidence:**
1. **Screenshots** - Upwork submission, Telegram messages, connected status
2. **Links** - Job URLs, Telegram usernames
3. **Timestamps** - When action completed
4. **Log within 24h** - Late logs may not be counted

**NLR spot-checks:**
- Random verification of screenshots
- Check Upwork submission history
- Verify Telegram connections
- Fraud = immediate removal + no payment

---

## Payment Timeline

**Mission compensation paid:**
- Weekly basis (every Friday)
- Via bank transfer or crypto (your choice)
- Bonuses paid when conversion verified (team member completes job, client pays)

**Example weekly statement:**
```
Week of 2025-11-07:
- Find and Propose: 5 jobs × $10 = $50
- Connect Telegram: 1 × $50 = $50

## Questions?

**"Can I do missions and job work simultaneously?"**
→ Yes! Missions are separate. You can hunt for jobs while also working on client projects.

**"What if I connect Telegram but don't message anyone?"**
→ You get the $50 connection bonus regardless. Messaging missions are optional.

**"Can I message the same contact twice?"**
→ No. Each contact = 1 message mission. Follow-ups don't count as separate missions.

**"What if someone I messaged joins 6 months later?"**
→ You still get the $50 bonus. Tracking is permanent.

**"What if I submit a proposal but we don't win?"**
→ You still get the $10. Compensation is for submission, not win (win rate is ~20-30% so volume matters).

**"How do I see my total mission earnings?"**
→ Mission Deck shows: "Mission Earnings: $X.XX (Week) | $Y.YY (Total)"
