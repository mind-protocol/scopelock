# ScopeLock Daily Job Search Strategy

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2025-11-05
**Owner:** Alexis (Strategy) + Emma (Execution) + Bigbosexf (Hunter)
**Purpose:** Systematic approach to finding and winning Upwork/Contra missions

---

## Executive Summary

**Goal:** Generate consistent pipeline of $6,000-12,000/month revenue through systematic job search and proposal submission.

**Approach:** Start at moderate volume (5-8 proposals/day), scale to high volume (10-15/day) with automation, add Contra in Phase 2.

**Success Metrics:**
- Phase 1 (Week 1-4): 2-3 jobs won/week, $800-1,800/week revenue
- Phase 2 (Month 2-3): 3-5 jobs won/week, $1,500-3,000/week revenue, Contra integrated
- Phase 3 (Month 4+): 5-8 jobs won/week, $3,000-6,000/week revenue, mostly automated

---

## Phase 1: Moderate Volume Upwork (Week 1-4)

### Daily Targets

**Applications:** 5-8 proposals/day
- **Why moderate volume:** Balance quality with pipeline building
- **Focus:** Perfect proposal templates while building momentum
- **Expected win rate:** 10-15% (1 in 7-10)

**Search Frequency:** 3-4 times/day
- **9:00 AM WAT:** Morning sweep (catch overnight posts)
- **11:00 AM WAT:** Mid-morning check (secondary wave)
- **2:00 PM WAT:** Afternoon sweep (lunch posts)
- **7:00 PM WAT:** Evening check (end-of-day posts)

**Why these times:**
- Upwork jobs get most proposals in first 2-6 hours
- Early application = higher visibility to client
- Multiple checks = don't miss high-value jobs

**Time Budget:**
- **Search:** 30-40 min/session × 4 = 2-2.5h/day
- **Proposals:** 15-20 min each × 6 avg = 1.5-2h/day
- **Follow-ups:** 15-30 min/day
- **Total:** 4-5h/day (Bigbosexf)

### Weekly Targets

**Proposals sent:** 30-40/week (5-8/day × 5 days)
**Jobs won:** 2-3/week
**Revenue:** $800-1,800/week
**Win rate target:** 10-15%

### Platform Strategy

**Upwork only** for first 4 weeks

**Why:**
- ✅ Learn one system deeply (proposal patterns, client psychology, JSS algorithm)
- ✅ Build concentrated reputation (testimonials compound faster)
- ✅ Simpler tracking (one inbox, one process)
- ✅ Emma's MISSION_SELECTION.md is Upwork-optimized

**Contra integration:** Phase 2 (Week 5+)

### Success Criteria (End of Week 4)

- [ ] 120-160 proposals sent total
- [ ] 8-12 jobs won
- [ ] $3,200-7,200 revenue accumulated
- [ ] 5+ testimonials captured
- [ ] JSS >85% (if enough jobs completed)
- [ ] Win rate stabilized (know what works)
- [ ] Proposal templates refined (Emma's confidence >80% accurate)

---

## Phase 2: High Volume + Contra Integration (Month 2-3)

### Daily Targets

**Applications:** 10-15 proposals/day total
- **Upwork:** 7-10/day
- **Contra:** 3-5/day (new platform)

**Search Frequency:**
- **Upwork:** 3 times/day (automated RSS alerts + manual checks)
- **Contra:** 2 times/day (morning + evening sweep)

**Time Budget:**
- **Upwork:** 2-3h/day (partially automated with Emma RSS)
- **Contra:** 1.5-2h/day (learning new platform)
- **Follow-ups:** 30-45 min/day
- **Total:** 4-5.5h/day (automation reduces Bigbosexf's load)

### Weekly Targets

**Proposals sent:** 50-70/week
- Upwork: 35-50/week
- Contra: 15-20/week

**Jobs won:** 3-5/week total
- Upwork: 2-4/week
- Contra: 1-2/week (lower win rate initially)

**Revenue:** $1,500-3,000/week
**Win rate target:** 15-20% (Upwork), 5-10% (Contra learning curve)

### Contra Integration Strategy

**Why add Contra in Phase 2:**
- ✅ Higher-value clients ($800-2,000 missions vs $200-600 Upwork)
- ✅ Less competition (smaller platform, more curated)
- ✅ Better client quality (verified companies, not individuals)
- ✅ Complementary to Upwork (different client psychology)

**Contra-specific approach:**
- Use existing portfolio (La Serenissima, Terminal Velocity, TherapyKin)
- Emphasize "Evidence Sprint" positioning (Contra clients love speed)
- Target AI integration missions (Contra skews tech-forward)
- See: `/docs/marketing/contra_tactical_guide.md` for platform specifics

**Week 5 Contra ramp-up:**
- Week 5: 2-3 proposals/day (learning)
- Week 6: 3-4 proposals/day
- Week 7-8: 4-5 proposals/day (standard)

### Success Criteria (End of Month 3)

- [ ] 200-280 proposals sent total (Upwork + Contra)
- [ ] 12-20 jobs won/month
- [ ] $6,000-12,000/month revenue
- [ ] 15+ testimonials captured
- [ ] Contra profile established (2-3 testimonials)
- [ ] Win rate 15-20% Upwork, 10-15% Contra
- [ ] Emma RSS auto-send deployed (Feature 4)

---

## Phase 3: Automated High Volume (Month 4+)

### Daily Targets

**Applications:** 10-15 proposals/day (mostly automated)
- **Emma auto-sends:** 80%+ confidence jobs (7-10/day)
- **Bigbosexf reviews:** Edge cases only (3-5/day)

**Search Frequency:** Automated + 1 manual check
- **Morning brief** (8:00 AM WAT): AI-generated job list for the day
- **Emma auto-send:** Throughout the day as RSS detects jobs
- **Evening review** (6:00 PM WAT): Bigbosexf checks edge cases

**Time Budget:**
- **Bigbosexf:** 1.5-2h/day (review Emma's work, handle edge cases, follow-ups)
- **Emma:** Automated (see automation specs below)
- **Total:** 2h/day human time (down from 5h in Phase 1)

### Weekly Targets

**Proposals sent:** 50-75/week
**Jobs won:** 5-10/week (updated: more conservative based on team capacity)
**Revenue:** $2,500-5,000/week
**Win rate target:** 20-25% (proven track record)

### Success Criteria (Steady State)

- [ ] 200-300 proposals/month automated
- [ ] 20-40 jobs won/month (sustainable with 3 developers)
- [ ] $10,000-16,000/month revenue
- [ ] 30+ testimonials
- [ ] JSS >95%
- [ ] Minimal human intervention (Emma handles 80%+)

**Team Capacity Check:**
- 5-10 jobs/week ÷ 3 developers = 1.7-3.3 jobs/week each
- With 2-7 day missions, each dev handles 2-3 concurrent jobs
- **This is SUSTAINABLE** with automation and proper handoffs

---

## Automation Integration (Phase 2-3)

### Morning Brief System

**Starting Phase 2:**
- **8:00 AM WAT:** Receive morning brief via Telegram
- **Brief includes:**
  - New jobs found overnight (Emma pre-screened using MISSION_SELECTION.md)
  - Proposals awaiting your review
  - Follow-up reminders (24h, 48h flags)
  - Win/loss updates from previous day

**How it works:**
- Cron triggers at 8:00 AM WAT
- Emma queries FalkorDB graph for your active tasks
- Emma writes personalized brief with context
- Sent to your personal Telegram DM with action buttons

**See:** `/docs/automation/01-morning-brief-spec.md` for complete technical specification

---

### Task Pipeline System

**Auto-task creation for won jobs:**
1. Emma finds promising job → Creates "Review proposal for Job #X" task
2. You click [✅ Approve] button → Creates "Submit proposal" task
3. Proposal submitted → Task marked complete
4. Job won → Creates entire mission pipeline:
   - Spec writing task (assigned to Reanance)
   - Implementation task (assigned to Kara, waiting on spec)
   - Deployment task (assigned to Kara, waiting on implementation)
   - QA testing task (assigned to you, waiting on deployment)
   - Client delivery task (assigned to Reanance, waiting on QA)

**Benefits:**
- No manual task creation
- Clear dependencies (implementation can't start until spec done)
- Everyone knows their role immediately
- Automatic handoffs when tasks complete

**See:** `/docs/automation/02-task-pipeline-spec.md` for complete state machine and rules

---

### Handoff Brief System

**When proposals are ready:**
- Emma drafts proposal → You receive handoff brief via Telegram
- **Brief includes:**
  - Job context (budget, client quality, timeline)
  - Emma's analysis (why this is a strong match)
  - Proposal draft with template used
  - Action buttons: [✅ Approve] [❌ Needs Revision] [👁️ View Job]

**When you approve:**
- Proposal auto-submits to Upwork/Contra
- Logged in leads-tracker.md and FalkorDB graph
- Follow-up reminders auto-created (24h, 48h)

**When job is won:**
- Mission pipeline auto-created
- Reanance receives handoff brief: "Ready to spec: Mission #47"
- All team members notified of their upcoming tasks

**See:** `/docs/automation/03-handoff-system-spec.md` for complete handoff flow

---

### Mission Deck Integration (Phase 2+)

**Emma's workspace in Mission Deck:**
- Upwork job feed embedded (if Upwork allows iframe)
- OR: Parsed job list via Upwork RSS/API
- Click job → Emma analyzes instantly
- [Analyze Job] button → Emma scores (0-13 points)
- [Draft Proposal] button → Emma drafts using templates
- Proposal appears in chat for your review

**Your workflow:**
1. Open Mission Deck at `scopelock.mindprotocol.ai/deck`
2. Select "Emma" workspace
3. Browse Upwork jobs in left panel
4. Click promising job → Chat with Emma about it
5. Click [Draft Proposal] → Emma writes it
6. Review in chat → Click [Approve] → Auto-submits

**See:** `/docs/missions/mission-deck/CITIZEN_WORKSPACES.md` for complete interface specification

---

### Graph-Based Tracking

**All proposals tracked in FalkorDB graph (Phase 2+):**

**Nodes created:**
- `U4_Work_Item` (proposal review tasks, submit tasks)
- `U4_Mission` (won jobs become missions)
- `U4_Agent` (you, Reanance, Kara)

**Links created:**
- `U4_ASSIGNED_TO` (who owns each task)
- `U4_DEPENDS_ON` (submit task depends on review task)
- `U4_TRIGGERED_BY` (audit trail: which button click created this task)

**Benefits:**
- Automatic follow-up reminders (graph queries for proposals >24h old)
- Win rate calculated from graph (won jobs ÷ total proposals)
- Pipeline visualization in Mission Deck
- Complete audit trail (every button click logged)
- No duplicate proposals (graph enforces uniqueness)

**Example graph query (find proposals needing follow-up):**
```cypher
MATCH (you:U4_Agent {telegram_id: '@Bigbosefx2'})
      -[:U4_ASSIGNED_TO]-(proposal:U4_Work_Item)
WHERE proposal.work_type = 'proposal'
  AND proposal.state = 'submitted'
  AND proposal.submitted_at < datetime() - duration({hours: 24})
  AND NOT exists((proposal)-[:FOLLOWUP_SENT]->())
RETURN proposal.name AS needs_followup,
       proposal.client AS client,
       proposal.budget AS budget
```

**See:** `/docs/automation/00-automatic-task-system-vision.md` for complete graph architecture

## Follow-Up Protocol

### When to Follow-Up

**24-48h after submission:**
- **Trigger:** Client viewed proposal but didn't respond
- **Action:** Send polite follow-up
- **Template:**
  ```
  Hi [Name],

  Following up on my proposal for [Job Title]. Happy to clarify any questions about the Evidence Sprint approach or timeline.

  Available for a quick call if helpful to discuss how we'd tackle [specific requirement from job post].

  Best,
  Bigbosexf
  ```

**When client responds with questions:**
- **Response SLA:** <2 hours during WAT business hours (9 AM - 6 PM)
- **Use:** Maya's templates for professional, clear answers
- **Escalate to:** Nicolas if client asks technical questions beyond scope

**When to stop following up:**
- **5-7 days:** If client hasn't viewed proposal
- **After 1 follow-up:** If client viewed but still no response
- **When job is filled:** Upwork shows "Contract awarded"

### Tracking System

**Emma's leads-tracker.md:**
- Logs every proposal sent (date, job title, budget, platform)
- Tracks status: submitted → viewed → interview → won/lost
- Auto-calculates follow-up dates (24h, 48h flags)
- Weekly summary (proposals sent, win rate, revenue)

**Review cadence:**
- Daily: Check for follow-up flags
- Weekly: Calculate win rate and adjust strategy
- Monthly: Identify patterns (which job types win most)

---

## Revenue Projections

### Week 1-4 (Phase 1: Moderate Volume Upwork)

**Effort:**
- 5-8 proposals/day × 20 days = 100-160 proposals/month
- Win rate: 10-15% = 10-24 jobs won

**Expected revenue:** $3,200-7,200/month

**Breakdown by week:**
- Week 1: $400-800 (1-2 jobs, learning)
- Week 2: $600-1,200 (2-3 jobs, templates refined)
- Week 3: $800-1,600 (2-4 jobs, momentum)
- Week 4: $1,000-2,000 (3-5 jobs, testimonials help)

---

### Month 2-3 (Phase 2: High Volume + Contra)

**Effort:**
- Upwork: 7-10 proposals/day × 20 days = 140-200/month
- Contra: 3-5 proposals/day × 20 days = 60-100/month
- Total: 200-300 proposals/month
- Win rate: 15-20% Upwork, 10-15% Contra = 28-60 jobs won

**Expected revenue:** $6,000-12,000/month

**Platform split:**
- Upwork: $4,000-8,000 (20-40 jobs @ $200-600)
- Contra: $2,000-4,000 (8-20 jobs @ $800-1,500)

---

### Month 4+ (Phase 3: Automated High Volume)

**Effort:**
- Emma auto-sends: 10-15 proposals/day × 20 days = 200-300/month
- Win rate: 20-25% = 40-75 jobs won
- **Conservative target:** 20-40 jobs/month (sustainable with 3 developers)

**Expected revenue:** $10,000-16,000/month

**Team capacity check:**
- 20-40 jobs/month ÷ 4 weeks = 5-10 jobs/week
- 3 developers (Reanance, Kara, Bigbosexf) = 1.7-3.3 jobs/week each
- With 2-7 day missions, each dev handles 2-3 concurrent jobs
- **This is SUSTAINABLE** with automation and proper handoffs

---

## Platform Strategy

### Phase 1 (Week 1-4): Upwork Only

**Focus:**
- Master Upwork proposal templates
- Build JSS and testimonials
- Understand client psychology
- Refine MISSION_SELECTION.md criteria

**Why not spread:**
- Concentrated reputation building (testimonials compound)
- Simpler tracking (one system to learn)
- Emma's templates are Upwork-optimized

---

### Phase 2 (Month 2-3): Add Contra

**Contra advantages:**
- Higher-value clients ($800-2,000 avg vs $200-600 Upwork)
- Less competition (smaller, more curated platform)
- Better client quality (verified companies)
- Faster payments (Contra pays faster than Upwork)

**Contra approach:**
- Emphasize portfolio (La Serenissima, Terminal Velocity proof)
- Position as "Evidence Sprint" specialist
- Target AI integration and web app missions
- Use contra_tactical_guide.md for platform-specific tactics

**Integration timeline:**
- Week 5: 2-3 Contra proposals/day (learning)
- Week 6: 3-4 Contra proposals/day
- Week 7-8: 4-5 Contra proposals/day (standard)

---

### Phase 3 (Month 4+): Evaluate Additional Platforms

**Potential additions:**
- **Toptal:** High-value clients, but strict vetting
- **Gun.io:** Developer-focused, good rates
- **Freelancer.com:** Low priority (price competition)
- **Fiverr:** Not recommended (race to bottom)

**Decision criteria:**
- Only add if Upwork + Contra can't sustain $20k/month
- Platform must support fixed-price, evidence-based delivery
- Client quality must be high (no tire-kickers)

---

## Success Metrics Dashboard

**Track weekly in Alexis's financial dashboard:**

### Lead Generation Metrics
- Proposals sent (Upwork / Contra / Total)
- Jobs viewed by client (engagement rate)
- Interview requests (interest rate)
- Jobs won (conversion rate)

### Quality Metrics
- Win rate % (jobs won ÷ proposals sent)
- Average response time (hours)
- Follow-up conversion (follow-ups → wins)
- Platform distribution (Upwork vs Contra)

### Revenue Metrics
- Revenue won this week
- Revenue delivered this week
- Revenue collected this week (accounting for Upwork delays)
- Average job value

### Efficiency Metrics
- Time per proposal (minutes)
- Proposals per hour
- Cost per acquisition (time × $100/hr ÷ jobs won)
- Emma automation % (Phase 3)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Low Win Rate (<10%)

**Symptoms:**
- Proposals viewed but not winning
- No interview requests

**Diagnosis:**
- Check proposal quality (too generic?)
- Check budget positioning (too high?)
- Check client targeting (wrong fit?)

**Solution:**
- A/B test proposal templates
- Lower bids temporarily (build testimonials)
- Narrow job selection criteria (higher quality leads)

---

### Risk: High Win Rate (>30%) But Low Revenue

**Symptoms:**
- Winning lots of jobs but all low-budget
- High volume, low profitability

**Diagnosis:**
- Targeting only $200-300 jobs
- Not bidding on higher-value missions

**Solution:**
- Shift to $400-800 tier missions
- Use testimonials to justify higher pricing
- Focus on AI integration (higher perceived value)

---

### Risk: Can't Keep Up With Won Jobs

**Symptoms:**
- Won 10 jobs, only 3 developers
- Delivery delays, quality issues

**Diagnosis:**
- Win rate too high for current capacity
- Need to slow down or hire

**Solution:**
- Reduce proposals temporarily (5/day → 3/day)
- Increase prices (natural demand throttle)
- Hire 4th developer (per Alexis team management plan)

---

### Risk: Platform Saturation (Too Many Proposals, Low Visibility)

**Symptoms:**
- Proposals not even viewed by clients
- Jobs have 30+ proposals already

**Diagnosis:**
- Applying too late (jobs already have many bids)
- Not targeting niche enough

**Solution:**
- Apply within first 2 hours of job posting
- Use RSS alerts for instant notifications (Feature 4)
- Target more specialized missions (AI integration)

---
