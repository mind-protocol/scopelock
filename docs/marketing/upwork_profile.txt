Solo engineer using AI-assisted development (Claude, Cursor, aider).

I architect systems, AI scaffolds implementation, I review/test every line before shipping. Result: 10-15 features/week vs. 2-3 for traditional solo dev.

Founder: La Serenissima (130+ AI agents, 6+ months production), Terminal Velocity (1.1k GitHub stars), Civocracy (€1M+ raised, exit). I build production systems through executable acceptance criteria and public proof.

GitHub shows 65K commits in 2024—I don't hide the AI tooling. Check commit messages: you'll see what's human-authored vs. agent-scaffolded.

Full disclosure: If you posted "No Agencies," I respect that. I'm not an agency—I'm a solo engineer who replaced a dev team with AI tooling. No subcontractors. No outsourcing. One architect, AI workforce, clear accountability.


WHAT SCOPELOCK DELIVERY MEANS

1. Co-Write Acceptance Criteria
   - Functional + non-functional requirements (what it does, how fast)
   - Executable tests + seed data (you can verify yourself)
   - Scope locked with git tag

2. Evidence Sprint (2-5 Days)
   - Working demo (≤90 seconds to test)
   - Quantified delta: "Signup p95: 1200ms → 280ms (↓77%), steps: 7 → 3"
   - Published proof entry

3. Payment at AC Green
   - All tests pass (CI green)
   - Performance thresholds met
   - Invoice only when complete


RECENT DELIVERIES

- La Serenissima: 130+ persistent AI agents, 6+ months production, 50,000+ state updates/hour
- Terminal Velocity: 1.1k GitHub stars (top 0.01% of GitHub projects), 526-page novel on Amazon
- KinKong: Autonomous trading bot, $7M capital deployment, 4x daily rebalancing, Solana DEX integration
- TherapyKin: AI therapeutic companion, HIPAA-aware privacy, 121+ production deployments
- DuoAI: Gaming companion with computer vision + voice, Claude vision API + ElevenLabs TTS

HOW I WORK

Phase 1: ScopeLock (Free)
- 30-60 min call, I draft acceptance criteria
- You approve scope and price
- Baseline locked with git tag

Phase 2: Evidence Sprint
- Working demo in 2-5 days
- Quantified before→after deltas
- You test and decide to continue

Phase 3: AC Green
- Full implementation
- All tests passing
- Invoice when complete

Scope Changes:
- Swap: Equal/lower complexity → $0, same milestone
- Add: New features → new milestone, priced separately


TECHNICAL STACK

Languages: JavaScript/TypeScript (15y), Python (10y), Solidity, Go, Rust
Frontend: React, Next.js, Vue, React Native, Tailwind
Backend: Node.js, FastAPI, Django, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
AI/ML: Claude API, GPT-5, custom orchestration, vector databases
Cloud: Render, AWS, GCP, Vercel, Docker, Kubernetes

HOW THE AI WORKFORCE WORKS

I use AI agents (Claude via Cursor, aider, custom tooling) as my development team:
- I architect the system and write acceptance tests (human, 2-4 hours)
- AI agents scaffold implementation (compress 10-20 hours of human typing to 30 mins)
- I review, integrate, test every line (human, 2-4 hours)
- Ship to production

Result: 10-15 features/week vs. 2-3 for traditional solo dev

GitHub shows 65K commits in 2024 (~178/day). Before you dismiss it as vanity:
- ~40% human-authored (architecture, tests, integration)
- ~60% AI-assisted (scaffolding via aider/cursor)
- All commits tagged with authorship—check commit messages yourself

The commit volume isn't the point. The point is throughput without coordination overhead.

This is 15 years of custom tooling + domain-specific AI infrastructure.


PRICING (Fixed-Price Milestones)

The AI workforce means faster delivery at lower cost. You're not paying $60-150/hr for a human to type boilerplate—you're paying for architecture, quality assurance, and accountability.

Evidence Sprint: $3,000–$6,000
- Working demo (≤90s), quantified delta, published proof
- Timeline: 2–5 days
- Best for: Validate approach, test collaboration

Feature to AC Green: $5,000–$15,000
- Full implementation, tests passing, 2 weeks adjustments
- Timeline: 1–2 weeks
- Best for: Single feature, MVP, core system

Week-Scale Integration: $15,000–$35,000
- Multiple Evidence Sprints, full integration, architecture docs
- Timeline: 2–4 weeks
- Best for: Multi-feature systems, complex integrations

Minimum: $2,500
Payment: 50/50 split (baseline + AC green)
Guarantee: Pay only when tests pass. Tests fail = we fix or refund.


WHAT I PREVENT

"2 Weeks" Becomes 5 Months
→ Executable acceptance criteria define "done", not judgment calls

Scope Creep Surprises
→ Change Control: every change is Swap ($0) or Add (new price), you approve first

"Tests Pass" But It's Broken
→ You can run the tests yourself, exact command + seed data in AC.md


WHAT'S THE CATCH?

"Pay only when tests pass" sounds too good. Here's how it actually works:

Q: What if I'm unreasonable and keep saying "not good enough"?
A: Acceptance criteria are executable tests written in code, not subjective judgment. If the tests pass, the milestone is done. If you want to change the criteria, that's a Change Request (Swap or Add).

Q: What if the tests pass but it's still broken?
A: Then the tests were wrong. I fix the tests and the code at no charge—that's on me. But if the tests correctly verify the original criteria and you want new criteria, that's a scope change.

Q: How do you prevent infinite revisions?
A: The AC includes a "Verification" section: exact command to run tests + seed data. When CI is green, milestone is done. You don't have to trust my judgment—you run the tests yourself.

Q: What if we discover the original scope was wrong?
A: Change Request. We document what changed, why, and whether it's Swap (replace at $0) or Add (new milestone, priced). You approve before I start. No surprise invoices.

Real scenario: Client wanted "fast" signup. AC said "<500ms p95". Tests passed at 280ms. Client then said "but I want it to feel faster with animations." That's a new requirement = Add milestone. Original milestone was done and paid.


PERFECT FOR

✓ Startups with investor demos approaching
✓ CTOs needing AI integration with measurable outcomes
✓ Emergency rescues (previous developer disappeared)
✓ Teams wanting clear acceptance criteria and proof

NOT FOR

✗ Long-term employment or CTO search
✗ Simple WordPress/Shopify sites
✗ Pure maintenance contracts
✗ Daily standups and Jira theatre
