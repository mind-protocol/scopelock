SMALL MISSIONS WANTED

I'm between strategic projects and prefer building over idle time.

Small missions let me:
- Stay current with new AI capabilities
- Test architectural patterns at small scale
- Build proof for larger consulting work
- Work with diverse clients and problems

You get senior architect rates at tactical mission prices.


HOW I WORK (Zero-Call Preferred)

1. Lock the Scope (6 hours) - Written Acceptance Criteria (AC.md) define exact deliverables, tests, timeline
2. Build + Deploy (2-7 days) - Daily updates, production deploy, demo video
3. Payment at Delivery - Pay when tests pass and deploy is live

No calls required. Async via Upwork messages creates documentation you can reference later.


PRICING (Fixed-Price, Pay at Delivery)

Quick Wins (2-3 days): $200-600
• Landing pages, bots, simple APIs

Standard Projects (3-7 days): $400-1000
• CRUD dashboards, payment integration, email automation

AI Integration (3-7 days): $350-1200
• PDF/document parsing, email processing, chatbots, content generation

Complex AI (1-3 weeks): $1500-5000
• Multi-agent systems, custom workflows, knowledge graphs

All pricing includes: Source code, deployment, documentation, demo video, 2 weeks adjustments.


WHAT I PREVENT

"2 Weeks" Becomes 5 Months
→ Written acceptance criteria define "done" before I start. Tests pass = project complete.

Scope Creep Surprises
→ New features discussed and priced before implementation. You approve changes in writing.

"It Works On My Machine"
→ Deployed to production. You test with your real data. Demo video proves functionality.

Communication Black Holes
→ Daily progress updates. Questions answered within 2-4 hours.


First projects typically start small ($300-800) to validate collaboration. Repeat clients get priority scheduling.
