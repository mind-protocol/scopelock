HEADLINE:
Software Engineer & Multi-Agent AI Specialist | ScopeLock Delivery

HOURLY RATE:
$200.00/hr (displayed but not used - we work fixed-price milestones)

===================================
OVERVIEW / PROFILE DESCRIPTION:
===================================

I lock scope and deliver against executable acceptance criteria. You pay only when tests pass.

Founder with La Serenissima (130+ persistent AI agents, 3+ months live), Terminal Velocity (1,051 GitHub stars), and Civocracy (€1M+ raised, successful exit). I build production systems through clear acceptance criteria, Evidence Sprints, and public proof.

Not a traditional freelancer - founder between ventures doing strategic delivery sprints.


WHAT SCOPELOCK DELIVERY MEANS

1. We Co-Write Acceptance Criteria
   - Functional + non-functional requirements (what it does, how fast)
   - Executable tests + seed data (you can verify yourself)
   - Scope locked with git tag

2. Evidence Sprint (2-5 Days)
   - Working demo (≤90 seconds to test)
   - Quantified delta: "Signup p95: 1200ms → 280ms (↓77%), steps: 7 → 3"
   - Published proof entry

3. Payment at AC Green
   - All tests pass (CI green)
   - Performance thresholds met
   - Invoice only when complete


RECENT DELIVERIES

- Rebuilt SaaS 48 hours before investor demo → Client raised $2M
- Fixed fintech authentication in 44 hours → Now processing $600K+ volume
- La Serenissima: 130+ persistent AI agents, 50,000+ state updates/hour, 99.7% uptime
- Terminal Velocity: 1,051 GitHub stars (top 0.01% of GitHub projects)
- 500+ projects delivered, average Evidence Sprint: 2-5 days


HOW WE WORK

Phase 1: ScopeLock (Free)
- 30-60 min call, I draft acceptance criteria
- You approve scope and price
- Baseline locked

Phase 2: Evidence Sprint
- Working demo in 2-5 days
- Quantified before→after deltas
- You test and decide to continue

Phase 3: AC Green
- Full implementation
- All tests passing
- Invoice when complete

Scope Changes:
- Swap: Equal/lower complexity → €0, same milestone
- Add: New features → new milestone, priced separately


TECHNICAL STACK

Languages: JavaScript/TypeScript (15y), Python (10y), Solidity, Go, Rust
Frontend: React, Next.js, Vue, React Native, Tailwind
Backend: Node.js, FastAPI, Django, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
AI/ML: Claude API, GPT-4, LangChain, custom orchestration, vector databases
Cloud: AWS, GCP, Vercel, Docker, Kubernetes
Scale: 20K+ requests/minute, millions of users, 99%+ uptime


THE TEAM

I work with specialized AI citizens (domain experts) handling:
- Architecture & event schemas
- Core development & acceptance tests
- Quality review & fail-loud enforcement
- Frontend, /proof UI, accessibility

This is 15 years of custom tooling + domain-specific AI infrastructure. Parallel work streams without coordination overhead.


PRICING (Fixed-Price Milestones)

Evidence Sprint: $3,000–$6,000
- Working demo (≤90s), quantified delta, published proof
- Timeline: 2–5 days
- Best for: Validate approach, test collaboration

Feature to AC Green: $5,000–$15,000
- Full implementation, tests passing, 2 weeks adjustments
- Timeline: 1–2 weeks
- Best for: Single feature, MVP, core system

Week-Scale Integration: $15,000–$35,000
- Multiple Evidence Sprints, full integration, architecture docs
- Timeline: 2–4 weeks
- Best for: Multi-feature systems, complex integrations

Minimum: $2,500
Payment: 50/50 split (baseline + AC green)
Guarantee: Pay only when tests pass. Tests fail = we fix or refund.


WHAT I PREVENT

"2 Weeks" Becomes 5 Months
→ Executable acceptance criteria define "done", not judgment calls

Scope Creep Surprises
→ Change Control: every change is Swap (€0) or Add (new price), you approve first

"Tests Pass" But It's Broken
→ You can run the tests yourself, exact command + seed data in AC.md


PERFECT FOR

✓ Startups with investor demos approaching
✓ CTOs needing AI integration with measurable outcomes
✓ Emergency rescues (previous developer disappeared)
✓ Teams wanting clear acceptance criteria and proof

NOT FOR

✗ Long-term employment or CTO search
✗ Simple WordPress/Shopify sites
✗ Pure maintenance contracts
✗ Daily standups and Jira theatre


VERIFICATION

Live Systems:
- serenissima.ai: 130+ agents running right now
- github.com/Lesterpaintstheworld: 1,051 stars, daily commits
- scopelock.dev/proof: Public milestone record (launching Q1 2025)

First call free: I'll show GitHub commits, live systems, and draft AC.md for your project.


HOW TO START

1. Message me with brief description of your need
2. Schedule ScopeLock call (30-60 min, free)
3. Review AC.md draft
4. Approve baseline (scope locked, price locked)
5. See Evidence Sprint (2-5 days: working demo + delta)
6. Pay at AC green (when tests pass)

No hidden costs. No hourly surprises. No ambiguity about "done."

Lock the scope. Prove the value.
