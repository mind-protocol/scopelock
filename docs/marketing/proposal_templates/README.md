# Proposal Templates

**Purpose:** Structured templates for the two main client archetypes, optimized to reduce friction and increase conversion.

---

## The Two Archetypes

### [Process-Skeptical Client](./process-skeptical-client.md)

**Use when:**
- "No Agencies" in job post
- Client mentions past disasters
- "Fixed price only" emphasis
- Technical founder/CTO doing own vetting
- Burned or cynical tone

**Strategy:** Lead with code/deliverables, minimize branded terms, make verification easy

**Key differences:**
- ❌ No "Evidence Sprint" → Use "Milestone 1"
- ❌ No "AC green" → Use "tests pass"
- ❌ No "ScopeLock" branding in signature
- ✅ "What's the catch?" section
- ✅ Deliverables BEFORE process

---

### [Process-Oriented Client](./process-oriented-client.md)

**Use when:**
- Job post mentions "testing," "CI/CD," "documentation"
- CTO or engineering leader at funded startup
- Client asks about methodology
- Tight timeline (investor demo, launch)
- Want structure and clarity

**Strategy:** Lead with methodology, explain process clearly, use branded terms confidently

**Key differences:**
- ✅ "Evidence Sprint," "AC green," "ScopeLock" used confidently
- ✅ Process explanation prominent
- ✅ "ScopeLock — Lock the scope. Prove the value." in signature
- ✅ "What this prevents" section
- ✅ Process + deliverables balanced

---

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Does job post say "No Agencies"?
├─ YES → Process-Skeptical
└─ NO
    └─ Does client emphasize process/testing/methodology?
        ├─ YES → Process-Oriented
        └─ NO → Process-Skeptical (safer default)
```

**If unsure:** Start with Process-Skeptical. You can introduce methodology after they engage.

---

## Template Components (All Proposals)

Both templates follow this structure:

1. **Hook** - Attention filter respect (keyword)
2. **Pushback** - Peer positioning
3. **Proof** - Verifiable links
4. **Deliverables** - Concrete code
5. **Process** - How we work (adapted by archetype)
6. **Pricing** - Transparent with estimates
7. **Catch handling** - Preemptive objections
8. **Question** - Strategic product focus
9. **Signature** - Links (adapted by archetype)

**Length:** 400-700 words depending on archetype

## Customization Checklist

Before sending ANY proposal:

### Replace Placeholders
- [ ] `[KEYWORD FROM JOB POST]`
- [ ] `[PRICE]` / `$[LOW]-[HIGH]`
- [ ] `[TIMEFRAME]` / `[days]`
- [ ] `[Project Name]`
- [ ] `[Deliverable 1-5]`
- [ ] `[location]` (France)
- [ ] `[time window]` (14:00-19:00 Central)
- [ ] `[strategic question]`

### Portfolio Selection
- [ ] Choose relevant project from portfolio
- [ ] Include live link
- [ ] Include GitHub link with metric
- [ ] Explain why capability is relevant

### Pricing Transparency
- [ ] Milestone 1 fixed price stated
- [ ] Milestone 2 estimate provided (if feasible)
- [ ] Total project range shown

### Question Strategy
- [ ] Product-focused (not logistics)
- [ ] Shows strategic thinking
- [ ] Helps you scope properly
- [ ] Examples:
  - "What does 'good' look like to you?"
  - "What are the 3 metrics investors will judge?"
  - "What's the current performance bottleneck?"

## Portfolio Snippets (Quick Reference)

**For vision AI / image analysis projects:**
```
We built DuoAI (duoai.vercel.app), a gaming companion that integrates Claude
vision API for real-time screen analysis. That same vision integration
capability applies directly to [their use case]...
```

**For multi-agent / complex AI systems:**
```
We built La Serenissima (serenissima.ai), an AI system with 130+ persistent
agents running for 6+ months in production (50,000+ state updates/hour). We
know how to ship complex AI systems that run reliably under load.
```

**For trading / financial systems:**
```
KinKong (konginvest.ai): Autonomous trading bot managing $7M capital, 4x
daily rebalancing, Solana DEX integration. Proves we can build real-time
financial systems with actual capital at risk.
```

**For consumer AI / therapy / wellness:**
```
TherapyKin (therapykin.ai): AI therapeutic companion with HIPAA-aware
privacy, 121+ production deployments. Proves we can handle sensitive data and
complex user journeys.
```

**For open-source credibility:**
```
Terminal Velocity (github.com/mind-protocol/terminal-velocity): 1.1k GitHub
stars, 526-page novel on Amazon. Top 0.01% of GitHub projects.
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Process-Skeptical Clients

❌ Using "Evidence Sprint" or "AC green"
❌ Leading with process before deliverables
❌ Including "ScopeLock" branding in signature
❌ Forgetting "What's the catch?" section
❌ Being vague about Milestone 2 pricing

### Process-Oriented Clients

❌ Being too brief about methodology
❌ Not explaining ScopeLock process
❌ Forgetting non-functional requirements in deliverables
❌ Not showing "What this prevents" benefits
❌ Generic logistics questions instead of strategic ones

### Both

❌ No verifiable links
❌ Generic portfolio mentions ("I have experience with...")
❌ Servile language ("I would be honored...")
❌ Hyperbolic claims ("revolutionary," "cutting-edge")
❌ Forgetting to customize [PLACEHOLDERS]
❌ Wrong length (too short = template, too long = desperate)

## After Sending

### If They Reply Positively

- Schedule call within their stated timeline
- Prepare to co-write AC.md during call
- Have portfolio demos ready to screen-share
- Bring strategic product questions

### If They Don't Reply

- Wait 3-4 days
- One follow-up only, with added value (not "checking in")
- Example: "Saw [recent news about their company]. Does this change the timeline for [feature]?"

### If They Push Back on Pricing

- Stand firm on value, but flexible on structure
- Offer: "We can split into smaller milestones if budget is tight"
- Don't: Lower price without reducing scope
- Explain: "The AI workforce means this is already 40-60% below market rate for the throughput"
