## Headline

**Software Engineer & Multi-Agent AI Specialist | ScopeLock Delivery**

---

## Hourly Rate

**$200.00/hr** (displayed but not used - we work fixed-price milestones)

---

## Overview

**I lock scope and deliver against executable acceptance criteria. You pay only when tests pass.**

Founder with La Serenissima (130+ persistent AI agents, 3+ months live), Terminal Velocity (1,051 GitHub stars), and Civocracy (€1M+ raised, successful exit). I build production systems through clear acceptance criteria, Evidence Sprints, and public proof.

Not a traditional freelancer - founder between ventures doing strategic delivery sprints. Not available for long-term employment or pure maintenance.

## What ScopeLock Delivery Means

**1. We Co-Write Acceptance Criteria (AC.md)**
- Functional requirements (what it does)
- Non-functional thresholds (performance p95, quality gates)
- Verification (executable tests + seed data)
- Scope locked with baseline tag

**2. Evidence Sprint (2-5 Days)**
- Working demo you can test (≤90 seconds to see value)
- Quantified delta (before → after with numbers)
- Published proof entry
- Example: "Signup p95: 1200ms → 280ms (↓77%), steps: 7 → 3 (↓57%)"

**3. Delivery at AC Green**
- All acceptance tests pass (you can run them yourself)
- Performance thresholds met
- Quality gates passed
- Payment triggered only when complete

**4. Public Proof**
- Every milestone tagged and published
- Demos, deltas, and criteria visible
- Example: scopelock.dev/proof (launching Q1 2025)

- Terminal Velocity: 1,051 GitHub stars (top 0.01% of GitHub projects)
- Multi-agent orchestration: 50,000+ state updates/hour, 99.7% uptime

**Rapid MVPs**

## How We Work Together

**Phase 1: ScopeLock (Free)**
- 30-60 minute call to understand your needs
- I draft AC.md with functional + non-functional criteria
- You review and approve
- Scope locked, price locked

**Phase 2: Evidence Sprint**
- Working demo in 2-5 days
- Quantified delta (numbers, not adjectives)
- You test and give feedback
- Published proof entry

**Phase 3: AC Green**
- Full implementation to acceptance criteria
- All tests passing (CI green)
- Performance thresholds met
- Invoice issued when complete

**Change Control (If Scope Changes):**
- **Swap:** Replace feature with equal/lower complexity → €0, same milestone
- **Add:** New features beyond original scope → new milestone, priced separately
- You choose, you approve pricing before we proceed

## The Team Structure

I work with specialized AI citizens (domain experts), each owning their area:

- **Architecture & Schemas:** Event-native design, /proof contracts
- **Core Development:** Features, acceptance tests, performance deltas
- **Quality Guardian:** Review verdicts, fail-loud enforcement
- **Frontend & UX:** Proof pages, accessibility, Lighthouse ≥90

This isn't ChatGPT wrappers - it's 15 years of custom tooling + domain-specific AI infrastructure. You get parallelized work streams without coordination overhead.

## Pricing Structure (Fixed-Price Milestones)

**Evidence Sprint**
- **Investment:** $3,000–$6,000
- **Deliverable:** Working demo (≤90s), quantified delta, published proof
- **Timeline:** 2–5 days
- **Best for:** Validate approach, show stakeholders, test collaboration

**Feature to AC Green**
- **Investment:** $5,000–$15,000
- **Deliverable:** Full implementation, all tests passing, 2 weeks adjustments
- **Timeline:** 1–2 weeks
- **Best for:** Single feature, MVP, core system component

**Week-Scale Integration**
- **Investment:** $15,000–$35,000
- **Deliverable:** Multiple Evidence Sprints, full integration, architecture docs
- **Timeline:** 2–4 weeks
- **Best for:** Multi-feature systems, transformations, complex integrations

**Minimum:** $2,500 (proof-of-concept Evidence Sprint)

**Payment:** 50/50 split (baseline + AC green) for >$5K, flexible for smaller engagements

**Guarantee:** You pay only when acceptance tests pass. If tests fail, we fix or refund.

## What Goes Wrong (And How I Prevent It)

**"2 Weeks" Becomes 5 Months**
- Solution: Executable acceptance criteria (no ambiguity about "done")
- Evidence Sprint shows working software in days, not weeks
- CI tests define completion, not judgment calls

**Scope Creep Surprises**
- Solution: Change Control (CHG-130) - every change is Swap (€0) or Add (new price)
- You approve pricing before work begins
- No surprise invoices

**Offshore Communication Hell**
- Solution: France-based, available 14:00–19:00 Central European Time
- Async-first via SYNC.md (status, blockers, links to proof)
- Most communication is artefacts (demos, deltas, tests), not meetings

**"Tests Pass" But It's Broken**
- Solution: You can run the tests yourself (Verification in AC.md includes exact command + seed)
- CI logs available
- Live walkthrough before payment if you want

---

## Perfect For

✅ CTOs needing AI integration with measurable outcomes
✅ Bootstrap founders validating ideas quickly

---

## Not For

❌ Long-term CTO search or employment
❌ Simple WordPress/Shopify sites
❌ Pure maintenance contracts (we build, you maintain)
❌ "We'll pay in equity"
❌ Anyone wanting daily standups and Jira theatre
