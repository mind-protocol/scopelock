# Token Incentives: Strategic Philosophy

**Created:** 2025-11-08
**Purpose:** Document WHY and HOW we use tokens as team incentives

---

## Core Principle

**Tokens are SIDE motivators, not primary compensation.**

Cash (30% pool from jobs) = real earnings
Tokens = achievement markers, status symbols, early access privilege

**Why this matters:** If tokens become the main value prop, we're just deferring payment with extra steps. Team needs real cash flow. Tokens are the upside bet.

---

## Strategic Design Choices

### 1. Competition Over Tasks

**WRONG:** Tokenize every action (+100 tokens per proposal, +50 per interaction)
- Makes tokens feel like payment replacement
- Creates accounting overhead
- Dilutes the "special" feeling
- Conflicts with cash compensation model

**RIGHT:** Tokens for milestones and competitions
- First to 10 proposals
- First job won
- Most jobs delivered this month

**Why:** Gamification creates urgency. Competition creates energy. Achievements feel earned, not transactional.

---

### 2. Competition Structure (Month 1)

**Competition 1: "First to 10 Proposals"**
- Winner: 100 tokens ($100)
- Deadline: 7 days from announcement
- First person to submit 10 Upwork proposals wins

**Competition 2: "First Job Won"**
- Winner: 100 tokens ($100)
- Single prize to first person who wins a client project

**Competition 3: "Most Delivered This Month"**
- Winner: 150 tokens ($150)
- Based on number of AC green deliveries in Month 1

**Total Month 1 Budget:**
- Competition prizes: ~350 tokens max
- Total: $350 at launch
- From 10M token pool: 0.0035% used

**Note:** No base grants. No "early access." Tokens only for achievements.

---

### 3. Crypto-Native Framing

**This is a BIG token:**
- Launch target: $1.00 per token
- Fully diluted valuation: $1B
- Total supply: 1B tokens
- Real infrastructure utility (AI compute credits)

**Why framing matters:**
- Crypto teams understand token upside (10x-100x potential)
- 100 tokens earned → potential $1K-$10K if token succeeds (10x-100x)
- Positions ScopeLock as serious project, not side hustle
- Team becomes stakeholders, not contractors
- Amounts are small achievement bonuses, but upside is real if token succeeds

---

### 4. Separation of Concerns

**Cash compensation:** Tracks interactions, immediate payment, predictable
**Token compensation:** Tracks achievements, deferred payment, speculative

**Why separate:**
- Cash solves "I need money now"
- Tokens solve "I want upside if this works"
- Two different motivations, two different systems
- Don't mix them or both get diluted

---

## What This Solves

### Problem: Team Not Activating
- Cash alone ($1/proposal + 30% pool) didn't motivate
- Team in crypto space, used to token upside
- Needed speculative incentive on top of cash

### Solution: Token Competitions
- Early access privilege (first 5 only)
- Achievement-based rewards (competitions)
- Clear expiration date (urgency)
- Crypto-native framing (BIG token narrative)

---

## What This Doesn't Solve

**Token incentives DON'T solve:**
- Immediate cash needs (tokens are future value)
- Team engagement issues (if they don't believe in project)
- Execution capability (tokens don't teach skills)

**Tokens only work if:**
- Team believes token will launch
- Team believes token will succeed
- Team has time/skills to actually do the work

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1: Token never launches**
- Transparent about risk (tokens are speculative)
- Don't promise guaranteed value
- Cash compensation independent of token success

**Risk 2: Token launches but fails**
- Same mitigation as above
- Tokens are bonus, not primary comp

**Risk 3: Team doesn't believe in token**
- If this doesn't work, pivot to solo strategy
- Don't over-invest in team activation
- 2-hour test window, then move on

---

## Implementation Philosophy

**Keep it simple:**
- Track allocations in spreadsheet (not complex system)
- Grant tokens manually when milestones hit
- Don't automate until pattern proves out
- Can always scale up complexity later

**Keep it flexible:**
- Competitions can change based on what works
- New competitions can be added mid-month
- Token amounts can adjust if needed
- This is experiment, not rigid contract

**Keep it transparent:**
- Team sees what others earn
- Competition results published openly
- Token allocation logic clear
- No secret rules or favoritism

---

## Success Metrics

**Token incentive succeeds if:**
- At least 1 team member commits within 2 hours
- That member submits 5+ proposals in Week 1
- Team delivers 1+ job by end of month

**Token incentive fails if:**
- 0 responses within 2 hours
- Responses but no action (commitment without execution)
- Team asks for tokens without doing work

**If fails:** Accept team model doesn't work, pivot to solo operator + direct outreach.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Tokens = side motivator** (not main value prop)
2. **Scarcity creates urgency** (first 5 only, expires Nov 15)
3. **Competition creates energy** (first to X, most Y)
4. **Crypto-native framing** (BIG token, early access privilege)
5. **Separate from cash** (two systems, two motivations)
6. **Test quickly** (2-hour window, then decide)
7. **Stay flexible** (can adjust competitions, amounts, rules)

---

**This is a mindset shift, not a payment system.**

If team doesn't respond to UPSIDE (tokens), they won't respond to anything. That's useful data. Move on to solo strategy.
