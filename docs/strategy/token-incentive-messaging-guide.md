# Token Incentive: Messaging & Communication Guide

**Created:** 2025-11-08
**Purpose:** How to talk about token incentives (tone, disclosure, exclusivity, timing)

---

## Core Messaging Principles

### 1. Confident but Honest

**Tone:** Matter-of-fact, not hype

**DO:**
- "We're launching $MIND token on Solana. Target price: $1.00"
- "You're the first 5 who can earn tokens. This window closes Nov 15."
- "Read the full economics: [link to doc]"

**DON'T:**
- "This token will 100% moon!"
- "Guaranteed 10x returns!"
- "You'll be rich if you do this!"

**Why:** Crypto teams can smell hype. They respect confident honesty more than promises.

---

### 2. Frame as Privilege, Not Payment

**Tone:** Exclusive access, not compensation

**DO:**
- "You're early. Founding team only."
- "After Nov 15, no one else gets this allocation."
- "Future team members won't have this opportunity."

**DON'T:**
- "Here's your token salary"
- "We're paying you in tokens"
- "Tokens instead of cash"

**Why:** Privilege feels valuable. Payment feels like deferred wages (which creates resentment if token doesn't launch).

---

### 3. Scarcity Without Manipulation

**Tone:** Natural scarcity, not artificial pressure

**DO:**
- "First 5 who commit get base allocation."
- "We're capping founding team at 5 members."
- "Expires Nov 15 because that's when we finalize founding roster."

**DON'T:**
- "Only 3 spots left! Hurry!"
- "This offer expires in 10 minutes!"
- "Last chance ever!"

**Why:** Real scarcity is credible. Artificial urgency is manipulative and backfires with savvy crypto people.

## How Much to Reveal

### What to Share Proactively

**1. Token Economics Exist**
- "Full token economics documented: [path to file]"
- "1B total supply, $1.00 target price, launching on Solana"
- "Usage Incentives pool: 90M tokens (your allocation comes from here)"

**2. Team Allocation Context**
- "10M tokens allocated for team incentives"
- "You're getting early access grants + competition bonuses"
- "This is bonus on top of cash (30% pool remains your main earnings)"

**3. Lock Period**
- "6-month lock after token launches"
- "Same as team allocation in token economics"
- "After 6 months: fully liquid"

**4. Risk Disclosure**
- "Token doesn't exist yet (we're tracking paper allocations)"
- "If token doesn't launch, allocations are cancelled"
- "This is speculative upside, not guaranteed payment"

**Why reveal all this:** Transparency builds trust. Crypto teams expect full disclosure.

---

### What NOT to Reveal Yet

**1. Exact Launch Date**
- **If asked:** "Launch timeline: Q1 2025 (finalizing after we prove ScopeLock revenue model)"
- **Why:** Don't commit to date we might miss. Gives flexibility.

**2. Other Team Members' Allocations**
- **If asked:** "Everyone starts equal (10K base). Competitions are public (you'll see leaderboard)."
- **Why:** Privacy + avoids comparison/jealousy early on.

**3. Total Team Token Budget**
- **If asked:** "We allocated 10M tokens for team incentives from the 90M Usage Incentives pool."
- **Why:** Enough info to show it's real, not so much they calculate dilution concerns.

**4. Investor Details**
- **If asked:** "Investors get 2% (20M tokens, 6-month lock). Read full economics doc for breakdown."
- **Why:** Keep focus on their opportunity, not investor terms.

## Handling Common Questions

### Q: "When will token actually launch?"

**Answer:**
"Launch planned for Q1 2025. We're finalizing after proving ScopeLock revenue model (need 3-5 paying clients first). Token economics are done (you can read full doc). Launch mechanics are straightforward (Solana deployment, initial LP, verified locks). Timeline depends on when we hit revenue traction."

**Tone:** Honest about dependency, confident about readiness

**Why this works:**
- Doesn't commit to exact date
- Ties launch to business success (not arbitrary timeline)
- Shows preparedness (economics done)
- Makes them part of the success (we need clients = we need you)

---

### Q: "What if token never launches?"

**Answer:**
"Then allocations are cancelled. This is speculative upside, not guaranteed payment. Your real earnings are cash (30% pool from jobs). Tokens are the bonus if Mind Protocol succeeds. That's why we're transparent about risk."

**Tone:** Direct, not defensive

**Why this works:**
- Acknowledges risk openly
- Reframes expectations (bonus, not payment)
- Points to cash as real compensation
- Shows confidence (we're not hiding risk)

---

### Q: "Why only 5 people? Why not more?"

**Answer:**
"Founding team = 5. After that, we're hiring for execution, not ownership. You're getting ownership-level allocation because you're early believers. Future hires get competitive pay, but not founding team tokens. This is the privilege of being first."

**Tone:** Exclusive, strategic

**Why this works:**
- Makes them feel special (ownership vs execution)
- Explains scarcity logically (not arbitrary)
- Creates status tier (founding vs future hires)

---

### Q: "Can I see the token contract / verify anything?"

**Answer:**
"Token isn't deployed yet (we're tracking paper allocations now). When we launch, you'll get:
- Token contract address (Solana/Solscan verification)
- LP lock verification link (Meteora/Team Finance)
- Your allocation distributed to your wallet
- Full transparency on-chain

For now: read the economics doc at [path]. That's what we're building to."

**Tone:** Transparent, process-focused

**Why this works:**
- Honest about current state (no fake contracts)
- Shows what transparency will look like later
- Points to documentation (proof of planning)
- Sets expectation for verification post-launch

---

### Q: "How do I know this is real / not a scam?"

**Answer:**
"Fair question. Here's how you verify:

1. Read token economics: [path] (detailed allocation, use cases, launch mechanics)
2. You're not paying anything (no investment required)
3. You earn tokens by doing real work (proposals, jobs)
4. Cash compensation (30% pool) is independent (you get paid regardless)
5. If token launches, everything is on-chain (verifiable)

This is speculative upside for early team members. If you don't believe in Mind Protocol, don't do the work. No pressure."

**Tone:** Calm, verifiable, non-defensive

**Why this works:**
- Provides verification steps (not just "trust me")
- No financial risk (they're not paying in)
- Work = value exchange (not speculative promise)
- Gives them an out (reduces pressure)

---

## Exclusivity Framing

### How to Talk About "First 5"

**DO:**
- "Founding team allocation"
- "Early believer privilege"
- "First 5 who commit get ownership-level tokens"
- "After Nov 15, this window closes"

**DON'T:**
- "Only 5 lucky people"
- "Race to be in top 5"
- "If you're not fast, you miss out"

**Why:** Exclusivity should feel like earned privilege (commitment), not lottery (luck/speed).

---

### How to Talk About "Expires Nov 15"

**DO:**
- "We're finalizing founding team by Nov 15"
- "That's when we transition from founding phase to execution phase"
- "After that, we're hiring for delivery, not ownership"

**DON'T:**
- "Arbitrary deadline"
- "Offer expires"
- "Limited time only"

**Why:** Tie deadline to business logic (founding → execution transition), not arbitrary pressure.

---

### How to Talk About "Big Token"

**DO:**
- "Mind Protocol: AI infrastructure token"
- "Planned launch: $1.00 per token, 1B supply"
- "Real utility: AI compute credits for autonomous agents"
- "Comparable to Render ($4B), Fetch ($2B) in AI infra space"

**DON'T:**
- "This will be the next Bitcoin"
- "Guaranteed moon mission"
- "We're going to dominate AI crypto"

**Why:** Let fundamentals speak (utility, comparable projects), not hype promises.

---

## When to Mention Token (Timing)

### Initial Activation Message (Already Sent)
- **Cash only:** 30% pool, per-interaction model, 4 hours/week commitment
- **No token mention:** Test if cash alone motivates

### If No Response by 02:30 UTC
- **Add token offer:** "BONUS: Token incentive on top of cash"
- **Frame:** "Additional upside for early believers"
- **Tone:** "Here's one more reason to join"

### If They Respond with Interest
- **Share full token economics doc:** [path]
- **Answer questions openly:** Use Q&A guide above
- **Grant base allocation when they commit:** 10K tokens logged

### After They Start Working
- **Track competitions:** Leaderboard for "First to 10 proposals" etc.
- **Public updates:** "Bigbo at 7/10 proposals, Reanance at 5/10"
- **Grant competition tokens:** When milestones hit

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Over-Promising
❌ "You'll make $100K from these tokens"
❌ "Token will 100% launch in January"
❌ "This is guaranteed wealth"

**Why bad:** Creates legal liability + trust damage when reality differs

---

### Under-Disclosing Risk
❌ Not mentioning token might not launch
❌ Hiding 6-month lock period
❌ Implying tokens are liquid immediately

**Why bad:** Feels like bait-and-switch when they learn later

---

### Manipulative Urgency
❌ "Only 10 minutes left!"
❌ "3 spots taken, 2 left!"
❌ Countdown timers

**Why bad:** Crypto teams see through this, kills credibility

---

### Unclear Value Proposition
❌ "Tokens are your payment"
❌ "We're replacing cash with tokens"
❌ Mixing cash and tokens in earnings calculation

**Why bad:** Confusion kills motivation, creates resentment

---

## Tone Examples (Good vs Bad)

### Introducing Token Incentive

**❌ BAD:**
"HUGE OPPORTUNITY!!! You can earn $MIND tokens that will MOON 🚀🚀🚀 Don't miss out! Only 5 spots! First come first serve!!!"

**✅ GOOD:**
"Adding token incentive on top of cash. You're the first 5 who can earn $MIND tokens (Mind Protocol's infrastructure token, launching Q1 2025). Base: 10K tokens. Competitions for more. Read full economics: [link]. This is bonus, not payment. Cash (30% pool) remains your main earnings."

**Why good works:**
- Calm, not hyped
- Information-dense
- Clear separation (bonus, not payment)
- Points to documentation
- Transparent about priority (cash > tokens)

---

### Answering "Why should I believe this?"

**❌ BAD:**
"Just trust me bro, this is going to be huge. I've never steered you wrong. You'll regret missing this."

**✅ GOOD:**
"Fair to be skeptical. Here's what's real:
1. Token economics documented (read it: [path])
2. You're not paying anything (no financial risk)
3. Cash compensation independent (30% pool paid regardless)
4. If token launches, everything verifiable on-chain
5. If token doesn't launch, allocations cancelled (we're transparent about risk)

If you believe in Mind Protocol, this is upside. If not, don't do the work."

**Why good works:**
- Validates skepticism (not defensive)
- Provides verification path
- Clarifies risk/reward
- Gives them an out (reduces pressure)
- Shows confidence (we're not desperate)

---

### Handling "When token?"

**❌ BAD:**
"Soon™" or "Q1 definitely" or "Can't say yet"

**✅ GOOD:**
"Launch planned Q1 2025, tied to ScopeLock revenue traction (need 3-5 paying clients first). Token economics done, launch mechanics straightforward. Timeline depends on business success, which depends on us winning jobs. That's why we need you."

**Why good works:**
- Honest about dependency
- Ties to business milestone (not arbitrary date)
- Shows preparedness (economics done)
- Makes them part of success (we need clients)
- No false precision ("Q1" not "January 15")

## Summary: Tone Checklist

Before sending ANY message about tokens, verify:

- [ ] Confident but not hyped
- [ ] Transparent about risk (token might not launch)
- [ ] Clear separation (tokens = bonus, cash = main earnings)
- [ ] Exclusivity feels earned (privilege), not lottery (luck)
- [ ] Deadline has business logic (not arbitrary pressure)
- [ ] No over-promising (no guaranteed returns)
- [ ] Provides verification path (economics doc, on-chain later)
- [ ] Gives them an out (reduces pressure)
- [ ] Matter-of-fact tone (not salesy)

**If any of these fail: rewrite message.**

---

## Final Principle

**The best way to make tokens credible: act like they're already valuable.**

- Don't beg people to accept tokens
- Don't over-explain or justify
- Don't create artificial urgency
- Just: "Here's what we're doing. You're invited. Here's the doc. Decide."

Confidence is the best marketing.
