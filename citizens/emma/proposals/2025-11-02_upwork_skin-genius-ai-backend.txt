You need the backend live so your MVP can launch. Seven deliverables is ambitious for $3,000, so let me propose a smarter path: we build the core value first (vision AI plus PDF generation), prove it works with real photos and acceptance tests, then expand to the full dashboard and product catalog as separate milestones with clear pricing.

We built DuoAI, a gaming companion that integrates Claude vision API for real-time screen analysis and generates contextual feedback in under 2 seconds. That same vision integration capability applies directly to skin analysis: upload photo, send to Claude/GPT-4o vision with structured prompt, parse JSON response, generate PDF with before-after layout. We know how to make vision APIs reliable in production, not just prototypes.

Here's how we work. We co-write acceptance criteria with you (what does "structured JSON skin analysis" actually contain? what triggers a passing test?). Then we build to those criteria and you pay only when the tests pass (AC green). For changes during development, you get Swap (replace features at same complexity, no charge) or Add (new milestone, priced upfront). Every milestone gets a public proof entry showing what shipped and what the delta was.

For Skin Genius, I recommend this Evidence Sprint: secure upload API (Supabase signed URLs), Claude vision integration returning structured skin analysis JSON, and automatic PDF generation with your logo, analysis summary, and placeholder routine. Deploy to Vercel with Postman collection. Seven days to demo, acceptance tests verify it works with real selfies. $3,000 fixed price.

After that Evidence Sprint proves the AI works, we scope the login system, dashboard, and product catalog as milestone 2. You see working vision AI and PDFs before committing to the full build. If the analysis quality isn't there, we fix it in the Evidence Sprint—not after you've paid for everything.

Nicolas is in France, available 14:00-19:00 Central (US time) for calls. We can kick off within 72 hours if you want to move fast. Reply with one thing: what does a "good" skin analysis look like to you (specific data points, tone, detail level)? That shapes the vision prompt and determines if 7 days is realistic or if we need 10.
