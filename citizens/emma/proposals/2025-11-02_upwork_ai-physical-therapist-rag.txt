You need an AI Physical Therapist that retrieves the right video based on user pain descriptions. Most developers build chatbots that hallucinate - you need a RAG system that only pulls from your verified treatment library.

I know you posted hourly, but I work fixed-price milestones. You know cost upfront, pay only when tests pass.

We built KinOS (RAG with hierarchical retrieval and multi-modal content), DuoAI (duoai.vercel.app - Claude vision API with real-time multimedia), TherapyKin (therapykin.ai - AI companion with persistent conversational flow). Verify at github.com/nlr-ai and github.com/mind-protocol (terminal-velocity 1.1k stars).

The core challenge is retrieval, not the LLM. Your AI needs to map "knee pain, bending motion, score 70" to the correct assessment flow, then retrieve the specific trunk twist video - not guess. That requires structured metadata, semantic search, and a decision tree matching pain patterns to protocols.

Milestone 1 ($4,500 fixed, 14 days):
1. Content ingestion - upload videos/images with metadata (body part, motion, difficulty)
2. RAG pipeline - embed protocols, match user pain to assessment sequence
3. Conversational flow - user describes pain, AI asks tests, scores 0-100, retrieves next video
4. Test with 10-20 exercises across 3 body areas
5. Acceptance - given knee pain, system walks through tests, retrieves correct videos, no hallucination

Before I start, we co-write acceptance criteria. What does passing look like? Which motion test for knee pain? What metadata do videos have? You pay only when tests pass.

Changes mid-build: Swap (same complexity, no charge) or Add (new milestone, priced upfront).

After Milestone 1 proves RAG works, we scope full library as Milestone 2. You see it working before committing to complete build.

Available 14:00-19:00 Central for calls. Kick off within 72 hours.

Reply with: what does your video metadata look like (filename conventions, tags, organization)? Determines if 14 days works or need 18.

Questions answered:
- Understand instructions? Yes. RAG retrieves verified content, guides motion assessments with scoring, follows your protocol. Question above re metadata.
- Live projects? DuoAI pulls real-time captures to Claude vision. TherapyKin retrieves contextual responses. KinOS is RAG foundation (github.com/mind-protocol/kinos10).
- Point person? I architect system, make technical decisions (embedding model, retrieval strategy, flow engine), solve problems before they surface. You own treatment expertise. I own making AI retrieve correctly.
- Certifications? No PT certs. I build AI systems that retrieve expert content accurately. You're the expert. I'm the RAG specialist making your expertise reach users correctly.
