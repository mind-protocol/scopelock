You need AI automation specialist who builds multi-modal pipelines (text, image, voice, video) transforming creative briefs into production-ready ad drafts, not someone chaining APIs. Goal: 80% automation.

I built Terminal Velocity (github.com/mind-protocol/terminal-velocity) - 526-page novel by 13 AI agents, 1.1k stars, proves multi-modal content at scale. Also La Serenissima (97 agents, 99.7% uptime 6+ months) - workflow automation with continuous improvement.

AI Automation - Creative Brief → Ad Drafts ($9K/mo to start):

Month 1: Build N8N system (creative briefs → multi-modal AI → ad assets), document pipeline, integrate Airtable + Notion + Meta. Deliverable: Brief → text/image/voice/video ad drafts, documented, Meta sync.

Month 2+: Expand coverage (80% target), continuous improvement (speed, accuracy, quality), optimize pipeline. Deliverable: Automation % increase, quality improvements, weekly updates.

Stack: N8N + Airtable + Notion + Meta + multi-modal AI (text/image/voice/video generation). Documented, maintainable.

Questions: 1) Current automation %? 2) Primary ad formats (video, carousel, static)? 3) Creative brief format?

Pay monthly. Swap/Add. GMT+1, US hours. Start 72h.
