You need healthcare AI engineer who handles sensitive medical + financial data, not generic React devs. LTC care planning requires privacy-first architecture and AI for complex decisions.

I built TherapyKin (therapykin.ai) - AI health companion with 121+ deployments, HIPAA-aware, helping users navigate healthcare decisions. Same domain as Waterlily: healthcare planning AI with sensitive data. Also La Serenissima (serenissima.ai) - 97 AI agents, 99.7% uptime 6+ months, proving we architect AI that scales.

Full-Stack Healthcare AI Engineer ($4.5K/mo to start):

Month 1: Onboard to codebase, understand LTC workflows, identify AI/LLM integration points, build first feature end-to-end. Deliverable: Shipped feature, documented architecture + privacy.

Month 2+: Care planning features, AI recommendations, LLM optimization (prompts, context, cost), privacy monitoring, weekly demos. Deliverable: 2-3 features/month, <300ms p95.

Stack: React + Node.js + AWS + TypeScript + OpenAI/Claude. Clean separation: frontend, API, LLM, data privacy layer.

Questions: 1) Current compliance requirements (HIPAA, financial)? 2) Greenfield or existing codebase? 3) Primary LLM use cases?

Pay monthly. Swap (free) or Add (priced) for scope changes. GMT+1, available US hours. Start 72h.
