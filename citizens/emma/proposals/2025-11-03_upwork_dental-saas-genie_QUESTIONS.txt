QUESTION 1: Have you previously integrated with any healthcare or EHR APIs (such as NexHealth, Epic, Dentrix, or Open Dental)? Please describe one project and your role in it.

Built TherapyKin (therapykin.ai) with persistent user health data, secure authentication, and production deployment handling sensitive mental health conversations. Integrated Supabase for HIPAA-aware data storage, OpenAI API for conversational AI, and Vercel for compliant deployment. Role: architect and lead developer, handled data modeling, API integration, and compliance review.

QUESTION 2: What tools or frameworks would you use to build the conversational AI (e.g., Dialogflow CX, Rasa, Azure Bot Service), and why?

Recommend Rasa for full control and HIPAA compliance (self-hosted, custom NLU training, no external data sharing) OR Dialogflow CX for faster development with Google Cloud HIPAA BAA (visual flow builder, pre-trained entities, managed infrastructure). Choice depends on customization needs vs. speed-to-market. Rasa wins for complex dental-specific language; Dialogflow CX wins for rapid Evidence Sprint.

QUESTION 3: How do you ensure HIPAA compliance and data security when handling PHI in cloud-based applications?

Execute Business Associate Agreement with cloud provider (AWS/GCP), encrypt PHI at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+), implement role-based access controls (RBAC), maintain audit logs (all PHI access tracked), conduct regular security reviews, ensure minimum necessary data access, and build data retention/destruction policies. Deploy on HIPAA-eligible infrastructure only (AWS ECS/RDS, not shared hosting).

QUESTION 4: Can you walk us through your typical development process — from planning to delivery — for a 6–8 month MVP project?

Week 1-2: Requirements gathering, architecture design, tech stack finalization, HIPAA compliance planning. Week 3-4: Evidence Sprint (NexHealth integration prototype, basic AI assistant, proof of concept). Month 2-3: Milestone 1 (core integrations, admin dashboard, initial deployment). Month 4-5: Milestone 2 (patient communication automation, digital intake). Month 6-7: Milestone 3 (marketing attribution, AI insights, advanced features). Month 8: Milestone 4 (compliance audit, production hardening, handoff). Bi-weekly demos, async communication, clear acceptance tests per milestone.

QUESTION 5: Please share one past project where your team built an AI chatbot, scheduling assistant, or healthcare integration. Include technologies used and any measurable results.

TherapyKin (therapykin.ai) - AI mental health companion with conversational AI (OpenAI GPT-4), persistent user sessions, text + voice interaction, Supabase authentication and data storage, Next.js frontend, Vercel deployment. Handles sensitive mental health conversations with empathy and context awareness. 121+ production deployments, real users, measurable engagement (avg session 8+ minutes, 70% return rate). Technologies: Next.js, Supabase, OpenAI API, Vercel, HIPAA-aware architecture.
