You need the backend live so your MVP can launch. Seven deliverables is ambitious for $3,000, so let me propose a smarter path: we build the core value first (vision AI plus PDF generation), prove it works with real photos and acceptance tests, then expand to the full dashboard and product catalog as separate milestones with clear pricing.

We built TherapyKin (therapykin.ai) with structured AI responses and PDF generation for user summaries, and La Serenissima (serenissima.ai) with 97+ agents processing real-time structured outputs. You can verify our work at github.com/nlr-ai (personal) and github.com/mind-protocol (org - includes terminal-velocity with 1.1k stars, therapykin, kinkong). That same structured AI integration capability applies directly to skin analysis: upload photo, send to Claude/GPT-4o vision with structured prompt, parse JSON response, generate PDF with before-after layout. We know how to make vision APIs reliable in production, not just prototypes.

Here's the actual work for Milestone 1 ($3,000 fixed, 7 days):

1. Secure upload API (Supabase signed URLs)
2. Claude vision integration → structured JSON skin analysis
3. PDF generation (your logo, analysis summary, placeholder routine)
4. Deploy to Vercel + Postman collection
5. Acceptance tests (works with real selfies, not just theory)

Before I start, we co-write the acceptance criteria together: What does "structured JSON skin analysis" actually contain? What triggers a passing test? I build to those criteria. You pay only when the tests pass.

If you want to change something mid-build: Swap (replace at same complexity, no charge) or Add (new milestone, priced upfront). No surprise invoices.

After Milestone 1 proves the AI works, we scope login, dashboard, and product catalog as Milestone 2. You see working vision AI and PDFs before committing to the full build. If the analysis quality isn't there, we fix it in Milestone 1—not after you've paid for everything.

What's the catch?

"Pay only when tests pass" sounds too good. Here's how it works: acceptance criteria are executable tests in code, not subjective judgment. When the tests pass, milestone is done. If you want to change the criteria, that's a scope change (priced upfront). If tests pass but it's still broken, I fix the tests and code at no charge—that's on me.

I'm in France, available 14:00-19:00 Central (US time) for calls. We can kick off within 72 hours if you want to move fast.

Reply with one thing: what does a "good" skin analysis look like to you (specific data points, tone, detail level)? That shapes the vision prompt and determines if 7 days is realistic or if we need 10.
