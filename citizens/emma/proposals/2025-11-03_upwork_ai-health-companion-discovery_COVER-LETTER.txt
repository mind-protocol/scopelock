You need technical scoping and cost estimates, but documentation alone won't prove the solution works. Most consultants give you a requirements doc, then you're back to square one hiring developers who may or may not deliver.

We built TherapyKin (therapykin.ai) - AI health companion with 121+ production deployments, HIPAA-aware architecture, symptom tracking, and personalized recommendations. This is exactly your product. Verify at github.com/nlr-ai and github.com/mind-protocol (terminal-velocity 1.1k stars).

Discovery Sprint: AI Health Companion Architecture + Working Prototype ($5,000 fixed, 3 weeks):

Week 1 - Requirements Workshop + Architecture Design ($1,500): Requirements workshop, technical architecture (mobile infrastructure, AI pipeline with RAG, symptom tracking model, document processing flow), HIPAA compliance strategy (BAA, PHI handling, encryption, audit logs), tech stack selection. Acceptance: Architecture document with diagrams, compliance checklist, tech stack recommendation.

Week 2 - Working Prototype ($2,500): Build functional prototype of either Symptom Chat (conversational AI on your health content, context retention, personalized recommendations) OR Medical Document Processing (upload PDFs/images, extract structured data, summarize findings). You choose priority. Acceptance: Working demo, AI responds to health queries OR processes medical documents, code repository.

Week 3 - Full MVP Cost Breakdown + Roadmap ($1,000): Detailed milestone breakdown for full MVP, cost estimate by component (AI integration, mobile app, backend, compliance, testing), risk analysis, phased rollout strategy. Acceptance: Milestone roadmap with costs, risk plan, deployment strategy.

Tech Stack: React Native (iOS + Android), OpenAI GPT-4 or Claude (health reasoning via RAG), Node.js/Python FastAPI (backend), PostgreSQL + vector DB (data + content), HIPAA-compliant AWS/GCP hosting.

TherapyKin Proof: We built therapykin.ai from concept to 121+ production deployments. Same patterns: AI reasoning over proprietary content, symptom tracking over time, document analysis, HIPAA-aware architecture (encryption, audit logs, secure data handling).

Full MVP Estimate: $40K-60K across 4-5 milestones, 16-20 weeks. Typical breakdown: mobile app foundation + auth ($8K-10K), AI chat with content integration ($10K-12K), symptom tracking ($8K-10K), medical document processing ($10K-12K), HIPAA compliance + deployment ($4K-6K).

HIPAA Compliance: Your product processes clinical data and medical documents, which means HIPAA regulations apply. We include compliance architecture from day one: BAA with cloud provider, encrypted storage (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit), audit logging, user consent workflows, data retention policies. This prevents costly rework and legal risk later.

Timeline: 3 weeks for Discovery Sprint. Available to start within 72 hours. Full MVP: 16-20 weeks depending on final scope.

Questions:
1. Primary user: Patients self-managing conditions or providers monitoring patients?
2. Priority for prototype: Symptom chat OR medical document processing?
3. Already have clinical content/data or need sourcing strategy?

Before we start, we co-write acceptance criteria. What does architecture doc need? Which health scenarios should prototype handle? How detailed should cost breakdown be? You approve milestones only when deliverables pass your tests.

Risk Reversal: Fixed $5,000. You own all code, architecture docs, and roadmap. If you hire us for full MVP, the $5,000 applies as credit toward Milestone 1.

Changes during Discovery: Swap features of equal complexity (no charge) or Add new deliverable (priced upfront).

Available 14:00-19:00 Central for calls. Can kick off within 72 hours.
