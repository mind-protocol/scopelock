You need technical scoping and cost estimates, but documentation alone won't prove the solution works. Most consultants give you a requirements doc, then you're back to square one hiring developers who may or may not deliver. You need discovery WITH working code that proves the approach.

We built TherapyKin (therapykin.ai) - AI health companion with 121+ production deployments, HIPAA-aware architecture, symptom tracking, and personalized recommendations. This is exactly your product. We've already solved the core challenges: training AI on health content, processing medical documents, tracking symptoms over time, and maintaining regulatory compliance. Verify at github.com/nlr-ai (personal, 65K commits) and github.com/mind-protocol (org, terminal-velocity 1.1k stars).

The core challenge is combining discovery with proof. You need architecture design and cost estimates, but you also need to see that we can actually build this. Most firms give you a PDF and disappear. We give you architecture docs PLUS a working prototype of one core feature so you can evaluate our AI integration approach, UX decisions, and health domain expertise before committing to full MVP.

Discovery Sprint: AI Health Companion Architecture + Working Prototype ($5,000 fixed, 3 weeks):

Week 1 - Requirements Workshop + Architecture Design ($1,500):
Requirements workshop (synchronous or async based on your availability), technical architecture design (mobile app infrastructure, AI pipeline with RAG for proprietary content, symptom tracking data model, medical document processing flow), HIPAA compliance strategy (BAA requirements, PHI handling and encryption, audit logging architecture, data retention policies), tech stack selection (React Native vs native iOS/Android, OpenAI GPT-4 vs Claude for health reasoning, vector database for content retrieval, cloud infrastructure AWS vs GCP). Acceptance: Architecture document with diagrams, compliance checklist, tech stack recommendation with rationale.

Week 2 - Working Prototype (ONE Core Feature) ($2,500):
Build functional prototype of either Symptom Chat (conversational AI trained on your health content, context retention across sessions, personalized recommendations based on user history) OR Medical Document Processing (upload medical PDFs or images, extract structured data with OCR and NLP, summarize findings in plain language). You choose priority. Acceptance: Working demo (mobile or web), AI responds accurately to health queries OR processes sample medical documents, code repository with setup instructions.

Week 3 - Full MVP Cost Breakdown + Roadmap ($1,000):
Detailed milestone breakdown for full MVP (features, timeline, acceptance criteria per milestone), cost estimate by component (AI training and integration, mobile app development iOS and Android, backend API and database, compliance implementation, testing and deployment), risk analysis (regulatory, technical, timeline), phased rollout strategy (alpha testing with controlled user group, beta expansion, production launch). Acceptance: Milestone roadmap with costs, risk mitigation plan, deployment strategy document.

Tech Stack (Proposed):
Mobile: React Native (iOS and Android from single codebase, faster MVP delivery)
AI: OpenAI GPT-4 or Claude (health reasoning, content-grounded responses via RAG)
Backend: Node.js or Python FastAPI (API for mobile app, document processing pipeline)
Database: PostgreSQL (user data, symptom logs) + vector database (health content retrieval)
Compliance: HIPAA-compliant hosting (AWS HIPAA-eligible services or GCP Healthcare API), encryption at rest and in transit, BAA with infrastructure provider
Document Processing: OCR (Tesseract or cloud OCR APIs), NLP for medical entity extraction

TherapyKin Proof Points:
We built therapykin.ai from concept to 121+ production deployments. The system handles persistent user conversations, provides personalized mental health recommendations, and maintains HIPAA-aware architecture (encryption, audit logs, secure data handling). Same technical patterns apply to your health companion: AI reasoning over proprietary content, symptom tracking over time, document analysis with structured outputs.

Similar technical challenges we solved: Training AI on specialized content (mental health protocols, now your health content), maintaining conversation context across sessions, generating personalized recommendations based on user history, processing unstructured inputs (text, now medical documents), ensuring regulatory compliance in healthcare domain.

Full MVP Estimate (After Discovery Sprint): $40,000-60,000 across 4-5 milestones over 16-20 weeks. Breakdown depends on feature scope from requirements workshop, but typical structure:
Milestone 1: Mobile app foundation + authentication ($8K-10K)
Milestone 2: AI chat with content integration ($10K-12K)
Milestone 3: Symptom tracking + history ($8K-10K)
Milestone 4: Medical document processing ($10K-12K)
Milestone 5: HIPAA compliance + production deployment ($4K-6K)

HIPAA Compliance Strategy:
Your product processes clinical data and medical documents, which means HIPAA regulations apply. Most developers ignore this until it's too late. We include compliance architecture from day one: Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with cloud provider, encrypted data storage (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit), audit logging (track all PHI access and modifications), user consent workflows, data retention and deletion policies, incident response procedures. This prevents costly rework and legal risk later.

Timeline: 3 weeks for Discovery Sprint (architecture + prototype + roadmap). Available to start within 72 hours. For full MVP: 16-20 weeks depending on final scope from requirements workshop.

Questions for Clarity:
1. Primary user: Patients self-managing chronic conditions or providers monitoring patients remotely?
2. Priority for prototype: Symptom chat (conversational AI) OR medical document processing (OCR + extraction)?
3. Do you already have clinical content and proprietary health data, or need sourcing strategy included?

Before we start, we co-write acceptance criteria for each week. What does architecture doc need to include? Which health scenarios should the prototype handle? How detailed should cost breakdown be? You approve milestones only when deliverables pass your tests.

Risk Reversal: Fixed $5,000 for Discovery Sprint. You own all code, architecture docs, and roadmap. If you hire us for full MVP after Discovery Sprint, the $5,000 applies as credit toward Milestone 1. If you don't proceed, you still have working prototype and complete cost breakdown to shop to other developers.

Changes during Discovery: If priorities shift (example: you want to prototype BOTH symptom chat AND document processing instead of one), we either Swap features of equal complexity (no charge) or Add a new deliverable as separate mini-milestone (priced upfront).

Available 14:00-19:00 Central for calls. Can kick off within 72 hours if you're ready to move.
