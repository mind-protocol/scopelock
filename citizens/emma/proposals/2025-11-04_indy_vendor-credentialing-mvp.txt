You need vendor credentialing MVP with OCR extraction, Symplr connector automation, compliance tracking - not someone learning healthcare SaaS on your project.

I built TherapyKin (therapykin.ai) - healthcare AI, 121+ deployments, HIPAA-aware, Next.js + Supabase. Same domain: healthcare workflows with sensitive data. Also built Playwright automation + OCR document processing.

Vendor Credentialing MVP ($9,500, 6 weeks):

Weeks 1-2 ($3K): Next.js + Supabase, OAuth + email/password, document upload (S3), OCR pipeline (credential type + expiry extraction). Deliverable: Upload + metadata extraction working.

Weeks 3-4 ($3.5K): Symplr connector (Playwright), credential sync, compliance status (Valid/Expired/Missing). Deliverable: One vendor portal syncing.

Weeks 5-6 ($3K): Dashboard, email/SMS alerts (Twilio), deployment (Vercel). Deliverable: Production MVP, 10 beta users.

Stack: Next.js + TypeScript + Supabase + Playwright + OCR + Twilio. HIPAA-aware (encrypted storage, audit logs).

Questions: 1) Symplr API or scraping? 2) OCR accuracy threshold? 3) Beta users ready?

Pay when tests pass. Swap/Add. GMT+1, US hours. Start 72h.

Projects:
• TherapyKin: therapykin.ai (healthcare, HIPAA-aware, 121+ deploys)
• BeatFoundry: beatfoundry.vercel.app (Next.js + Supabase, 55 deploys)
• GitHub github.com/nlr-ai + github.com/mind-protocol
