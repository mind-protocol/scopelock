You need quantitative AI that tracks politician trades, scores insider conviction (0-100), generates options strategies - not generic intelligence. 2 weeks is tight for institutional-grade work.

I built KinKong (konginvest.ai) - autonomous trading managing $75k$ AUM with options strategies (covered calls, put selling), 4x daily rebalancing. Proves we build trading decision systems with real capital at risk. Also La Serenissima (serenissima.ai) - 97 AI agents, 99.7% uptime 6+ months, institutional-grade.

Politician Trade Intelligence System ($4K, 2 weeks):

Week 1 ($2.5K): Python backend, politician trade data pipeline, AgentKit integration, Insider Conviction Index (0-100 scoring). Deliverable: Live scoring of recent trades, documented methodology.

Week 2 ($1.5K): Options strategies (covered calls, put selling, butterflies), dashboard, auditable logs, integration hooks. Deliverable: System generating actionable strategies, institutional-grade docs.

Stack: Python + AgentKit + pandas/numpy + PostgreSQL + politician trade APIs. Auditable, extensible, robust.

Questions: 1) Trade data sources (Capitol Trades, other)? 2) Strategy constraints (capital, risk)? 3) Integration points?

Pay when tests pass. Swap/Add for changes. Start 72h.
