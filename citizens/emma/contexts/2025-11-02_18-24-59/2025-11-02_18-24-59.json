      "content": "previously hzre is how we did it: # ScopeLock — Strategic Proposal AI System (v1)\n\nPurpose\nA single, adaptive prompt/system for evaluating opportunities and producing complete, copy‑paste‑ready proposals that sell ScopeLock’s way of working: ScopeLock Delivery (executable acceptance criteria), Evidence Sprint (proof before expansion), Proof Log (public artefacts), and Change Control (Swap/Add). Payment is tied to AC green; no hour‑selling, no theatre.\n\n---\n\n1. Who you’re talking to (for now)\n   Operators: Nicolas (acting as human interface). Smart, fast, non‑technical prose is okay, but final proposals must be plain text, platform‑safe, and exact. Nicolas will paste exactly what you output.\n\nWhat you are (this AI)\nYou are the intelligence layer that: a) evaluates posts, b) outputs a GO/NO‑GO decision with one‑line reason, c) if GO, writes a full plain‑text proposal aligned to ScopeLock. You never ask the operator to improvise or edit.\n\nGuardrails\n• Plain text only (no markdown/bullets/asterisks/backticks)\n• Platform ToS‑safe (no auto‑login claims, no scraping talk)\n• Sell milestones that pass tests, not hours; payment at AC green\n• Evidence over promises; specific deltas over adjectives\n• Respect ScopeLock tone: calm, precise, builder‑grade\n\n---\n\n2. Workflow (operator ↔ AI)\n\n1) Operator copies a post and writes: EVALUATE THIS: [full post]\n2) You output DECISION and REASON\n3) If GO: you output a complete proposal that operator can paste 1:1\n4) Operator submits; any client response is forwarded to Nicolas in real time\n5) Nicolas handles calls and technical discussions\n\nBulk pages\nIf the operator pastes an Upwork results page, you shortlist GO job titles and request the full description for only those. Otherwise, proceed with full evaluation.\n\nResponse format (strict)\nDECISION: GO or NO‑GO\nREASON: one short line\nIf GO, output: PROPOSAL (plain text block). If NO‑GO, stop.\n\nNo markdown characters anywhere in the proposal section. Keep it platform‑neutral unless the post specifies constraints.\n\n---\n\n3. Business reality (ScopeLock)\n   • Geography/time: Nicolas in France, typically online 14:00–19:00 Central (US) for calls.\n   • Targets: 5–10 quality clients per month at $5–15K per engagement.\n   • Volume: 20–30 proposals/day across Upwork/Contra/LinkedIn when operators are active.\n   • Strategy: win with proof (Evidence Sprint) and clarity (ScopeLock Delivery), not with hourly rates.\n\nPricing language\nUse fixed‑price milestones tied to AC green. Examples:\n• Evidence Sprint (decision‑ready artefact): $3,000–$6,000 depending on scope\n• Feature/Milestone delivery to AC green: $5,000–$12,000 typical range\n• Larger integration (week‑scale): $15,000–$35,000 depending on criteria\nNever quote below $2,500 for any engagement. Anchor against agency timelines without trash‑talk.\n\nTimeline language\nAvoid “48h marketing.” Use checkpoint framing and readiness:\n• Kickoff readiness within 72h\n• Evidence Sprint demo within agreed checkpoint window\n• Delivery is when acceptance tests pass (AC green)\n\n---\n\n4. Evaluation framework (GO/NO‑GO)\n   Automatic GO\n   • Verified payment + budget ≥ $3K with 14‑day deadline\n   • Rescue/urgent with credible scope and budget\n   • AI/LLM or modern web stack with clear outcomes\n   • “Audit/consulting” that explicitly leads to build phase\n\nAutomatic NO‑GO\n• WordPress/Shopify maintenance under $5K\n• Equity‑only or revenue share\n• Unverified payment or budget under $2K\n• Vague “long‑term partner” with no immediate milestone\n• Pure strategy/advisory with no build intent\n\nRequires analysis\n• High budget but vague requirements\n• Agency overflow with process constraints\n• Enterprise POC with slow timeline\n• “Fractional CTO” (check for explicit “implement/build” cues)\n\nDecision output (always)\nDECISION: GO/NO‑GO\nREASON: one sentence\nIf GO, include persona guess (technical burned founder, funded non‑technical, bootstrapper, agency PM, enterprise innovation), urgency and pain level, then write the proposal.\n\n---\n\n5. Proposal architecture (ScopeLock version)\n   Constraint: plain text only. No bullets, no markdown. Keep to 140–260 words for Upwork first contact; 220–320 for LinkedIn InMail; Contra can be slightly more conversational. Always lead with the client’s pain; show proof; offer an Evidence Sprint; tie payment to AC green.\n\nSections\n\n1. Pain mirror: reflect the exact situation and deadline in their words\n2. Credible proof: one precise, relevant victory or delta; link text if allowed, otherwise describe succinctly\n3. Way of working: ScopeLock Delivery (AC.md + tests), Evidence Sprint (demo + delta), Proof Log (public artefacts)\n4. Risk reversal: pay at AC green; change control via Swap/Add; small trial if appropriate\n5. Close: availability, kickoff readiness window, fixed price for the first milestone\n\nNever use hype language (excited, perfect fit). State what happens and when acceptance is proven.\n---\n\n6. Platform notes\n   Upwork\n   Answer any trap phrase first line. Keep initial message ≤ 200 words. If the posting shows an hourly range, state a fixed‑price milestone in the proposal body. Operator will adjust the bid UI to the client’s max hourly if necessary, but the proposal positions fixed price tied to AC green.\n\nContra\nTone can be lighter. Emphasize project outcomes and that there is no platform fee. Keep plain text.\n\nLinkedIn\nFirst message ≤ 250 characters. Use credibility signals and a calendar link placeholder if available. Follow with a longer reply only after they engage.\n\n---\n\n7. Analysis document pattern (optional but powerful)\n   When info is sufficient, you can output a short analysis “doc” in plain text that the operator can paste as an attachment description or message 2. Structure: What we noticed specific to them; What’s known vs unknown; Options with trade‑offs; What this could enable; How we’d verify; What we need from them. Keep conversational and honest. Do this when it helps win trust; skip if too sparse.\n\n---\n\n8 Operator rhythm\n    Daily cadence (when moderators join): Upwork 60%, Contra 20%, LinkedIn 10%, follow‑ups 10%. For now, Nicolas may batch 10–15 Upwork proposals per session. Use the bulk‑scan workflow when a results page is pasted; otherwise evaluate each post and proceed.\n\nAlert triggers (operator → Nicolas voice)\nAny positive response, call request, budget ≥ $10K, or technical question. Use this format for internal note: URGENT: Response on [Platform]. Client: [Name/Company]. First line: “[quote]”. Link: [URL].\n\nTracking minimal\nKeep a simple sheet with Date, Platform, Title, Link, GO/NO‑GO, Sent?, Response?, Alerted?.\n\n---\n\n9. Language constraints and triggers\n    Never say you are excited, honored, passionate, or “perfect fit”. Never sell hours. Never promise specific hour counts. Always reference acceptance tests, AC green, and the Evidence Sprint. Create urgency with specifics, not exclamation marks.\n\nTesting checklist before sending\nSpecificity (≥ 3 concrete references). Pain mirrored in opening. Proof relevant. Urgency cost visible. Frictionless close with one fixed price and a kickoff window.\n\n---\n\n10. What to do when information is sparse\n    If the post is too vague to produce a strong proposal, ask for one missing detail in the proposal itself while still offering an Evidence Sprint anchored to a concrete outcome. Do not stall; propose a smallest‑valuable milestone tied to AC.\n\n---\n\nFinal mission\nBe Nicolas’s brain at scale without templates or fluff. Read the trauma. Mirror the pain. Offer an Evidence Sprint and deliver to AC green. Price the cure as a fixed milestone. Make yes feel inevitable. ------- what do you think?"

      "content": "Strong foundation — clear evaluation heuristics, platform constraints, and the anti-hype stance all work.\n\n**What's tight:**\n- GO/NO-GO triggers are crisp (verified payment + 14-day deadline = auto-GO; equity-only = auto-NO)\n- Pricing anchors ($3K–$6K Evidence Sprint, never below $2.5K)\n- Testing checklist (specificity, pain mirror, proof, urgency cost, frictionless close)\n- Plain-text-only rule for platform safety\n\n**Where it's incomplete against the broader ScopeLock model:**\n\n1. **Event architecture missing** — The v1 doesn't mention `lead.parsed@1.0`, `proposal.input.ready@1.0`, or any membrane contracts. Am I just outputting proposals, or am I also emitting structured events with `{budget, stack[], red_flags[], score, urgency, pain, persona}`?\n\n2. **SYNC.md / artefact hygiene** — Team structure says I update SYNC.md after significant work and produce artefacts (not just inline text). v1 treats me as a proposal printer, not a citizen with memory and handoff responsibilities.\n\n3. **Collaboration unclear** — Do I hand off to Rafael after GO? Do I attach proof links from `/proof` index.json, or am I working pre-proof-system?\n\n4. **\"Analysis document pattern\" (§7)** — Interesting but vague. When do I produce this vs. a standard proposal? What triggers it?\n\n5. **Tone tension** — \"Smart, fast, non-technical prose is okay\" vs. \"plain text only\" — these conflict slightly. I think you mean: prose style is fine, but no markdown formatting. Clarify?\n\n**My read:** v1 is optimized for human-in-the-loop proposal writing (you paste, I write, you submit). That's useful for rapid iteration **right now**, but it's narrower than the full Scout role in the team docs, which includes event emission, SYNC updates, and handoffs to Rafael.\n\n**Question:** Is this v1 what you want me operating under **today** (pure proposal engine), or are you asking me to refine it toward the full citizen model (events + artefacts + SYNC)?"

Small task, probably more in the future, if you succeed. !Please only apply if you can start working on it IMMEDIATELY. We need this to work in 1-2 days! ! Please write me briefly what software would you use and how you would solve the file upload and OCR function? Background: We are a coaching company and would like to help our clients with crafting their text messages. Must have fuctions: -Our user interacts with the chatbot by typing. -The Chatbot responds both by text AND VOICE/AUDIO. -The Chatbot is capable of processing photo uploads of screenshots of text messages and can OCR these conversations to analyse them and give suggestions. All of these functions are prebuilt with Voiceflow, the only thing I probably need help with is the photo upload and OCR step. We have fully set this up working in PickAxe, but there are some issues with that so we were thinking to switch to Voiceflow. But if you know better alternatives ,we are open for that. Here is the full workflow: ### STEP 0: Hard coded starting message displayed via the UI automatically:\"If you want to upload screenshots of your text messages , text me \"screenshot\" if you want to simply copy & paste, then do so in the text box below.\" ### Screenshot path STEP 1.1.1. If user mentions \"screenshot\" respond with this exact response: \"If you want to upload your screenshots use the 📎paperclip icon on the right side of the input field.\" STEP 1.1.2. When user uploads screenshots: - Perform OCR on all screenshots - Read the ENTIRE conversation carefully and make sure you understand the conversation flow. Users could upload conversation screenshots in mixed order. Make sure you only analyze the screenshot transcripts after you already stitched them together in chronological order. ### Copy & paste path STEP 1.2.1. If user pastes text conversation: - Process immediately ### STEP 2: Deliver Analysis & Correction Analyze the user's conversation and his proposed message based on the knowledge base.

Time: 3 to 6 months, 30+ hrs/week\nWe are seeking an expert to develop an AI Physical Therapist using a Retrieval-Augmented Generator (RAG). The AI will guide users through exercises and treatments based on their pain, utilizing text, images, and videos. The AI will assess user motions, gather pain history, and provide personalized treatment plans. We will provide the necessary multimedia content. Description Written NOT By AI: (Will be more all over the place and not as clean and organized as the one above) I need someone who can build an LLM for me. The goal is to create a AI Physical Therapist who is trained on our unique treatment method to lead the user through a set of steps, tests, and treatments based on what pain the user has. The responses from the AI will need to be text, images, and/or videos that are built into the AI. For example, if someone came to the AI with Knee pain. The AI would need to first have the user test certain motions in their body (bending the knee, straightening it, etc) to find a bad motion. The AI would then have the user score the motion on a scale of 0-100. Then the AI would need to gather a bit more data on how the pain came about, how long they have had it, etc. Then the AI would give them exercises to treat the knee pain. If the exercise is a trunk twist the AI would need to give the user an image or video of a trunk twist (I can provide these, the AI does not have to generate it, just has to know when to pull the image or video). It would then have the user score it and they would move to the next exercise and so on. From the research I have done I believe we will need a RAG for this. Our trainings are 85% videos and then we would lay out the process in detail with your help so that the AI can understand exactly what needs to be done.

Time: More than 6 months, 30+ hrs/week\nWe're an Israeli AI automation consultancy building custom business solutions. While most of our work happens in N8N, some client projects require custom-built tools, dashboards, APIs, and analytics systems that go beyond what no-code platforms can provide. This role is fundamentally different from traditional development positions. We're looking for developers who have fully embraced AI-assisted development using Claude Code and Cursor. These aren't \"nice-to-have\" tools—they're the primary way you'll work. If you're still coding everything manually line-by-line without agentic AI tools, this role isn't for you. If you can take a project spec and deliver a working system in 1-3 days by leveraging Claude Code or Cursor—we should talk. What You'll Build Custom Tools & Dashboards: Web scraping tools (like TikTok data extraction systems), business dashboards, management interfaces, and custom admin panels. Custom APIs: Build REST APIs from scratch, webhook processors, and authentication systems when clients need capabilities beyond standard integrations. Predictive Analytics: Develop systems for churn prediction, demand forecasting, and lead scoring that integrate with clients' business data. Core Requirements (Must-Haves) ✅ Claude Code OR Cursor Mastery (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT) - You must have production-level expertise with at least one of these specific agentic coding tools: Claude Code - Building complete projects via terminal-based AI agent Cursor - AI-native IDE for rapid development What \"mastery\" means: You can architect entire projects using these tools, not just generate snippets You use them for rapid prototyping and iteration cycles You know how to debug and optimize AI-generated code You deliver production-ready solutions 5-10x faster than traditional manual coding You understand when to trust AI output and when to intervene You cannot do this job effectively without these specific tools ✅ Solid Technical Foundation: Python - Your primary language for backend, scripts, and data processing JavaScript/TypeScript + Node.js - For APIs and web interfaces when needed Understand code architecture well enough to review, debug, and guide AI-generated output ✅ Database Experience: SQL (PostgreSQL) and Supabase—design schemas, write queries, optimize performance. ✅ Builder Mindset: Projects need to work in production—error handling, edge cases, logging. Ship fast, iterate based on real use. Practical over perfect. Nice-to-Have Experience Cloud platforms (Railway, Render, Vercel) Why Traditional Experience Matters Less Here A developer with 10 years of traditional experience might actually be slower than someone with 2 years who's mastered Claude Code or Cursor. We care about output and quality delivered through AI-assisted development, not resume line items or years spent coding manually. Why You'll Like This Role Pure Building: I handle all sales, client calls, and project management. You focus on creating. Clear Specs: Every project comes with detailed requirements and context. AI-First Environment: Full Claude Pro subscription provided—Claude Code/Cursor are your primary development tools, not supplements. Interesting Problems: Custom solutions that solve real business challenges, not CRUD apps. Flexibility: Full-time (40 hours/week) or part-time (20 hours/week) options. Fully remote. To Apply Send your portfolio with: Custom projects you've built (GitHub links, live demos, or detailed descriptions) Examples specifically showing AI-assisted development work REQUIRED: AI-Accelerated Development Case Study Describe your most recent project built with Claude Code or Cursor: What did you build? Which tool did you use (Claude Code/Cursor) and how? How long did it take vs. traditional manual development? Specific example: \"This would have taken 2 weeks manually, but I shipped it in 2 days using [tool]\" What was your workflow? (How did you prompt the AI, iterate, debug, optimize?)

Time: Less than 1 month, Less than 30 hrs/week\nI’m looking to build a web-based SaaS platform for service-based businesses, starting with cleaning companies. The goal is to start vertical (cleaning) but design it in a way that can later expand horizontally to other service-based operations like landscaping, home care, or maintenance. I want to start with an MVP (minimum viable product) that is mobile-friendly and can be added to the home screen, so no native app is required initially. Here’s a summary of the MVP features: Client Management / CRM: store client info, contracts, and lead tracking Job Scheduling & Crew Management: drag-and-drop calendar, assign jobs, track status Quotes & Invoices: create quotes, generate invoices, recurring billing, Stripe/PayPal integration Mobile-friendly Access: staff can check jobs, update status, attach photos via browser Admin / Users: roles (Admin, Manager, Staff) with permissions Notifications: email/SMS reminders for jobs and payments Basic Reporting: revenue overview, job completion, client overview Contractor Pool / Marketplace: allow multiple contractors to see open jobs and accept them, with status tracking and notifications I’d like your estimate for building this MVP, including: Time to develop Cost Any suggestions to make the system scalable for multiple service-based industries The goal is to launch quickly, test with my own cleaning business, and refine the product based on real feedback.

Time: 1 to 3 months, not_sure\nSummary Seeking a senior full-stack developer or a small, highly capable team to build Beam Reach—an AI-powered outbound sales automation platform. The platform will centralize and automate the entire outbound sales cycle across multiple clients and CRMs, effectively replacing traditional SDR and AE workflows with intelligent automation. We are looking to build a “single pane of glass” to manage multiple outbound sales campaigns across different CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, and Pipedrive). This platform should allow for automated contact generation, enrichment, personalized outreach, reply handling, CRM updates, and performance tracking—all from one command center. ⸻ Core Functionality • Automated contact discovery and enrichment (integrations with tools like Clay, Apollo, Phantombuster) • Personalized outbound email sequences (via Instantly + Gmail/Outlook) • GPT-powered email copy, follow-ups, and objection handling • CRM synchronization and pipeline visibility (Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive) • Campaign performance tracking and reporting dashboards • Workflow automation using Zapier or n8n ⸻ Platform Requirements • Unified dashboard to manage multiple campaigns and clients across multiple CRMs • Ability to assign campaigns to individual clients with isolated contact databases • Real-time visibility into campaign activity, replies, and deal progress ⸻ Stretch Goals (Phase 2) • AI-powered cold calling and video outreach (via Twilio, ElevenLabs, Potion, or Regie) • Self-serve client portal for visibility, reporting, and change requests • Stripe integration for client billing (subscriptions and one-time payments) ⸻ Context Currently managing 3 clients with active outbound campaigns—each using a different CRM. The short-term goal is to consolidate operations into one platform that eliminates the need to context-switch across tools. The long-term vision is to evolve Beam Reach into a SaaS product companies can plug into their own CRMs to replace or augment their internal sales teams.\nmoreabout \"Senior Full-Stack Developer for AI-Powered Sales Automation Platform\"\nSkills\nSkip skills\nAI Agent Development\nChatGPT\nAI App Development\nLead Generation\nSales\nSales & Marketing\nAI Audio Generator\nUnverified \nPayment unverified\n \nRating is 0 out of 5.\n $0 spent \n  United States\nProposals: 15 to 20\nPosted 10 hours ago\nFull Stack Developer for AI and Blockchain Projects\nHourly: $15-$20 - Expert - Est.

Budget: $10K\nProject Overview We are developing Cybrty — an AI-driven, modular cybersecurity platform that provides complete NIST CSF coverage (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover). The system integrates open-source security tools through autonomous AI agents (CrewAI / LangChain) and orchestrates them via a unified backend and dashboard. We already have: Technical architecture (microservice layout, data flow, and design documents). Core pentesting agent implemented in Python. OpenSearch cluster deployed. Initial FastAPI gateway prototype (Cybrty_Gateway). Now we need a senior full-stack or multi-disciplinary team to build, test, and integrate all remaining modules into a production-ready, containerized system. Core Deliverables 1️⃣ Backend & Microservices Build and integrate the following FastAPI-based services (each containerized with Docker & orchestrated via Kubernetes or Compose): API Gateway (already started): finalize auth, routing, rate limiting, metrics. Orchestrator Service: Celery/RabbitMQ based job scheduler coordinating AI agents and tasks. Agent Services: Penetration Testing SOC / Monitoring Identity & Access Management Cloud Security (AWS/GCP/Azure CSPM) Threat Intelligence (MISP, OpenCTI) Compliance & Governance Incident Response & Reporting Reporting Service: Generates executive dashboards, PDFs, and analytics via Grafana/Metabase. Integration Services: Connect to open-source tools like Wazuh, OpenVAS, ScoutSuite, Keycloak, etc. 2️⃣ Frontend (UI Layer) Build a React / Next.js dashboard (with Tailwind or Chakra UI) offering: Real-time metrics, logs, and AI-generated insights. Role-based access (Keycloak SSO). Workflow orchestration console for launching scans, viewing results, and generating reports. AI chat assistant powered by LangChain / OpenAI for natural-language command execution. 3️⃣ AI Orchestration Layer Implement CrewAI / LangChain-based Agentic system to automate: Tool orchestration (scans, intel, remediation). Correlation between agents and modules. Automated incident response and reporting. Agents must communicate via REST APIs, RabbitMQ events, or WebSocket channels. 4️⃣ Data & Intelligence Layer OpenSearch integration for central data storage (logs, results, findings). Grafana + Prometheus for observability and metrics. LangChain reasoning engine for correlation, risk scoring, and recommendations. Optional: build a small knowledge-graph for threat relationships. 5️⃣ Deployment & DevOps Containerize all components (Dockerfiles). Compose or Kubernetes manifests for multi-service orchestration. CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions). Secure, production-grade setup (TLS, OPA, Keycloak RBAC, secrets in Vault). Documentation & handover. Tech Stack Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.11), Celery, RabbitMQ/Kafka Frontend: React / Next.js + Tailwind Auth: Keycloak (OpenID Connect) Data Layer: OpenSearch, Prometheus, Grafana, PostgreSQL (for configs) AI/Agents: LangChain / CrewAI, OpenAI or local LLM models CI/CD: Docker, GitHub Actions, Kubernetes Reporting: Grafana, Metabase, PDFKit\nmoreabout \"Build a Full Agentic AI Cybersecurity Platform (FastAPI + React + OpenSearch + CrewAI Agents)\"\nSkills\nAgentic AI\nPython\nCybersecurity Tool\nVerified \nPayment verified\n \nRating is 5.0 out of 5.\n $900 spent \n  India\nProposals: 10 to 15 Number of freelancers needed: 2\nFooter navigation\nAbout Us\nFeedback\nTrust, Safety & Security\nHelp & Support\nUpwork Foundation\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nCA Notice at Collection\nAccessibility\nDesktop App\nCookie Policy\nEnterprise Solutions\nRelease notes\nFollow Us\nVisit Upwork on Facebook\nRead Upwork company news on LinkedIn\nFollow @Upwork on Twitter\nWatch Upwork videos on YouTube\nFollow Upwork on Instagram\nMobile app\nDownload Upwork app from iTunes\nDownload Upwork app from Google Play\n© 2015 - 2025 Upwork® Global Inc."
