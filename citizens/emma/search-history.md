# Emma's Search History Log

**Purpose:** Track all Upwork search queries to avoid repetition and ensure variety across sessions.

**Usage:**
- **Before each session:** Check this log to see what queries were already used
- **After each session:** Add new entry with search query, jobs filtered, and proposals sent
- **Goal:** Vary search terms to discover different opportunities each day

## Query Variation Strategy

**Core search elements to vary:**
- Tech stack combinations (Next.js + Python, FastAPI + React, etc.)
- Problem domains (AI integration, chatbot, automation, etc.)
- Urgency signals (urgent, ASAP, immediate, etc.)
- Keywords (MVP, prototype, full-stack, backend, frontend)

**Example queries to rotate through:**
- `AI integration Python Next.js`
- `FastAPI React MVP urgent`
- `ChatGPT API wrapper full-stack`
- `Multi-agent system Python`
- `Voice AI integration Next.js`
- `Automation backend FastAPI`
- `LLM integration urgent delivery`
- `AI chatbot Python React`

**Rule:** Never repeat the same query within 7 days.
