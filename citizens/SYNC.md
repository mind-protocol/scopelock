**Phase 1 In Progress:**
- 🔄 /faq — Reviewing detailed Q&As from spec (organized by Delivery, Pricing, Technical, Working Together, Guarantees)

**Phase 2 (Legal — Created, needs spec review):**
- ⚠️ /terms — Basic structure present, needs alignment with 12-section spec
- ⚠️ /privacy — Basic structure present, needs alignment with 10-section GDPR spec

**Phase 3 (Authority — Created, may need refinement):**
- ✅ /process — Deep dive on delivery model
- ✅ /case-studies — Three detailed examples with metrics
- ✅ /blog — Four articles on Evidence Sprints, AC, CHG-130, quality
- ✅ /contact — Cal.com embed, email, availability

**Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Custom 404 page (not-found.tsx)
- ✅ SEO infrastructure (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)

**Upwork Lead Pipeline:**

**Blocker:** Emma tooling is manual-paste only. No automated listing fetch or submission exists.

**What's built:**
- ✅ Emma prompt (citizens/emma/CLAUDE.md)
- ✅ Decision framework (GO/NO-GO)
- ✅ Proposal template (ScopeLock 5-section)

**What's missing:**
- ❌ Upwork listing fetcher (RSS/API/scraper)
- ❌ Lead storage/tracking
- ❌ Submission automation (or manual paste workflow)

**Options:**
1. **Manual:** User pastes 20 posts → Emma evaluates → User submits
2. **Build tooling:** RSS reader → Emma auto-processes → outputs proposals
3. **Hybrid:** Automated fetch, manual submit (ToS-safe)

**Requests:**
- Clarify workflow: do you have 20 Upwork posts ready to paste?
- Or: should I build a listing fetcher?

**Owner:** Priya (awaiting user input)
**Next:** TBD based on user preference
