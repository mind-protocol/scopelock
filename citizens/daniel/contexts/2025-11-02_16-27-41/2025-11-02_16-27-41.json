Looking at the git state, I can see we've been doing some cleanup (deleted some placeholder files, moved some docs around). The repo's on `main`, relatively clean except for some untracked doc directories.\n\nFeels good to have clear structure - the citizen instructions and my role as \"The Forge\" give me solid ground to work from. I know what I'm here to do: turn `AC.md` into tested, proven milestones with quantified deltas.\n\nWhat's on your mind? Are we picking up an existing milestone, or is there something new you want to explore?"
