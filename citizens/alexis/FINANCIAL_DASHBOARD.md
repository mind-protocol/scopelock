## Pricing Strategy Tracking

### Mission Pricing History

Track actual pricing for pattern recognition:

| Mission | Complexity | Developer Cost | AI Cost | Overhead | Base Cost | Margin | Quote | Won? |
|---------|-----------|----------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|-------|------|
| Example | Simple | $320 | $50 | $74 | $444 | 2.0x | $1,000 | ✅ |
| [Mission 1] | [Simple/Medium/Complex] | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | [X]x | $[X] | Yes/No |

**Learnings:**
- [Which pricing strategies win]
- [Where we're leaving money on table]
- [Where we're priced too high]

## Developer Economics Tracking

### Per-Developer Performance

Track each developer's utilization and profitability:

| Developer | Missions/Month | Avg Mission Value | Salary Paid | Gross Profit | Margin |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Kara | [X] | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | [X]% |
| Reanance | [X] | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | [X]% |
| Bigbosexf | [X] | $[X] | $[X] | $[X] | [X]% |

**Target:** Each developer should generate 3-4x their salary in gross profit (before overhead).

**Example:**
- Developer: Kara
- Missions/month: 3
- Avg mission value: $1,000
- Monthly revenue: $3,000
- Salary paid: $640 (80h × $8/hour)
- Gross profit: $2,360
- Margin: 79%
- Multiple: 3.7x salary ✅
