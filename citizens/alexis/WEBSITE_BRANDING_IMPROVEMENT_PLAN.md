# ScopeLock Website & Branding Improvement Plan

**Created:** 2025-11-07
**Owner:** Alexis (Strategic Operations)
**Status:** Draft for Nicolas approval
**Timeline:** 2 weeks (high priority items), 4 weeks (complete overhaul)

---

## Executive Summary

**The Problem:** ScopeLock's website is technically impressive but business-unfriendly. ARKCEL's site converts better because it speaks to business outcomes, not technical process.

**The Root Cause:** We designed for engineers who appreciate "executable acceptance criteria" and "65k commits." But our buyers are founders/CTOs who care about "Will this work? Will it cost what you say? Can I trust you?"

**The Strategic Shift:**
- **FROM:** Technical proof as hero content (AC.md, commits, proof log)
- **TO:** Business outcomes as hero content (speed, reliability, fixed price), with technical proof supporting trust

**Expected Impact:**
- Proposal win rate: 15% → 30% (business-friendly messaging)
- Average project value: $400 → $800 (premium positioning)
- Time-to-conversion: 5 days → 2 days (clearer CTAs)

## Comparative Analysis: Why ARKCEL Wins

### What ARKCEL Does Right (That We Don't)

**1. Business-First Language**
- ❌ **ScopeLock:** "Software locked to executable acceptance criteria" (what does this mean?)
- ✅ **ARKCEL:** "Transform Ideas Into Market-Ready Digital Products" (clear outcome)

**2. Visual Hierarchy & Skimmability**
- ❌ **ScopeLock:** Dense text blocks, proof log, commit feed (overwhelming)
- ✅ **ARKCEL:** Icons, whitespace, numbered process, collapsible FAQ (easy to scan)

**3. Multiple Entry Points**
- ❌ **ScopeLock:** "Start with Evidence Sprint" repeated (single path)
- ✅ **ARKCEL:** "Get Product Roadmap," "Start Building," "Get Free Estimate," "Schedule Call" (4 paths)

**4. Social Proof for Non-Technical Buyers**
- ❌ **ScopeLock:** Technical metrics (proof log, commits, AC green tags)
- ✅ **ARKCEL:** Client logos, "Trusted by startups and enterprises" (business credibility)

**5. Segmented Content by Audience**
- ❌ **ScopeLock:** Single long page mixing marketing + technical proof + pricing
- ✅ **ARKCEL:** Marketing page → separate sections for web dev, app dev, FAQ, contact

## Strategic Recommendations (Prioritized by Impact/Effort)

### Tier 1: HIGH IMPACT, LOW EFFORT (Week 1-2)

**These changes require copywriting/design tweaks only, no major dev work.**

#### 1.1 Rewrite Hero Section (Business-First)

**Current:**
```
Hero H1: "Software locked to executable acceptance criteria"
Hero pitch: "I write tests with you, you pay only when tests pass"
Subtext: "Solo engineer + AI team. 65k commits in 2024."
CTA: "Start with Evidence Sprint"
```

**Problems:**
- "Executable acceptance criteria" = technical jargon
- "I write tests with you" = focus on process, not outcome
- "65k commits" = means nothing to business buyers
- Single CTA limits conversion paths

**Recommended Rewrite:**

```
Hero H1: "Build the Right Product. Pay Only When It Works."

Hero pitch: "Fixed-price software development with AI-assisted delivery.
We co-write success criteria with you, deliver working software in 2-7 days,
and you only pay when tests pass. No scope creep. No surprises."

Subtext: "Trusted by 8+ startups. 121+ deployments. 99.7% uptime."

Primary CTA: "Get Free Estimate" (new, broader appeal)
Secondary CTA: "See Our Work" (links to proof log)
Tertiary CTA: "Schedule 15-min Call" (low friction)
```

**Why this works:**
- "Build the Right Product" = outcome, not process
- "Pay Only When It Works" = risk reversal (business buyers care about this)
- "2-7 days" = speed (competitive advantage over traditional agencies)
- "No scope creep" = addresses #1 pain point
- Multiple CTAs = more conversion paths
- Social proof moved from commits → deployments + uptime (business metrics)

**Owner:** Alexis (draft copy) → Nicolas (approve) → Whoever updates website
**Timeline:** 3 days

---

#### 1.2 Add Client Logos / Anonymized Case Studies

**Current:** No client logos, no testimonials, only technical proof log.

**Problem:** Business buyers don't trust technical metrics alone. They want to know "Who else have you worked with?"

**Recommended:**

**Section: "Trusted By" (below hero, before process explanation)**

If clients allow logo use:
```
[TherapyKin logo] [KinKong logo] [La Serenissima logo]
"Trusted by 8+ startups in AI, healthcare, and fintech"
```

If confidentiality required:
```
"We've delivered for:"
- AI companion platform (121+ deployments, 1.2M users)
- Trading infrastructure ($75K AUM, Solana DEX)
- Multi-agent orchestration (97 agents, 99.7% uptime)
```

**Why this works:**
- Logo section = instant credibility (ARKCEL does this)
- Anonymized metrics = trust without breaking NDAs
- "AI, healthcare, fintech" = shows domain expertise

**Owner:** Alexis (draft copy) → Nicolas (approve client disclosure) → Maya (get client approval if needed)
**Timeline:** 5 days

---

#### 1.3 Simplify Process Explanation (Business Stages, Not Technical Steps)

**Current:**
```
1. Co-write AC.md with functional + non-functional criteria
2. Evidence Sprint → 90s demo + quantified delta
3. Build → AC Green → Payment
```

**Problem:** Business buyers don't know what "AC.md" or "AC Green" means.

**Recommended Rewrite:**

```
HOW IT WORKS: Four Steps to Delivered Software

1. DISCOVERY & PLANNING (Day 1)
   We write success criteria with you. What must work? How fast? What quality?
   Output: Acceptance Criteria document (your protection against scope creep)

2. EVIDENCE SPRINT (Days 2-3)
   We build a working demo in 2-3 days. You see it, approve it, or request changes.
   Output: 90-second demo + measurable improvements (e.g., "Load time: 2.3s → 0.8s")

3. BUILD & TEST (Days 4-7)
   We complete the full implementation. AI generates code, humans deploy and test.
   Output: Working software that passes all acceptance tests

4. DELIVERY & SUPPORT (Day 8+)
   Tests pass → you pay. We hand off code, documentation, and 1-week support.
   Output: Production deployment + proof log (permanent evidence of delivery)
```

**Visual:** Numbered timeline with icons (like ARKCEL's 5-step process)

**Why this works:**
- Maps to ARKCEL's Discovery → Design → Development → Deployment → Support flow
- Uses business-friendly language ("success criteria" not "AC.md")
- Shows timeline (2-7 days) for each stage
- Explains outputs, not just process

**Owner:** Alexis (draft copy) → Inna (review for accuracy) → Nicolas (approve)
**Timeline:** 3 days

---

#### 1.4 Add Multiple CTAs Throughout Page

**Current:** "Start with Evidence Sprint" appears 2x (hero + bottom)

**Problem:** Only one conversion path. If visitors don't want "Evidence Sprint," they bounce.

**Recommended CTAs (Prioritized by Friction):**

**Low Friction (Top of Page):**
- "Schedule 15-min Call" (calendar link)
- "See Our Work" (links to proof log)

**Medium Friction (Mid-Page):**
- "Get Free Estimate" (simple form: name, email, project description)
- "Download Case Study" (PDF of La Serenissima or TherapyKin)

**High Friction (Bottom of Page):**
- "Start with Evidence Sprint" (full contact form)

**Where to Place:**
- Hero section: "Get Free Estimate" (primary), "Schedule Call" (secondary), "See Our Work" (tertiary)
- After process explanation: "Get Free Estimate"
- After pricing section: "Start with Evidence Sprint"
- After proof log section: "See All Projects"
- Footer: "Schedule Call" + social links

**Why this works:**
- ARKCEL has 5+ different CTAs across the page
- Visitors at different readiness stages need different actions
- More CTAs = more conversion opportunities

**Owner:** Alexis (define CTA strategy) → Whoever updates website (implement)
**Timeline:** 2 days

---

### Tier 2: HIGH IMPACT, MEDIUM EFFORT (Week 2-3)

**These changes require design work + content creation.**

#### 2.1 Visual Design Refresh

**Current Issues:**
- Dark teal + green = less polished than ARKCEL's dark + purple
- No icons, no illustrations, no product screenshots
- Text-heavy sections (proof log, commits) overwhelm visitors

**Recommended Changes:**

**Color Palette:**
- **Background:** Deep charcoal (#0A0F14) or navy (#0E1420)
- **Accent 1:** Bright cyan (#00E5CC) for CTAs (replaces current green)
- **Accent 2:** Soft purple (#8B7FFF) for highlights (adds sophistication)
- **Text:** White (#FFFFFF) for headings, light gray (#B8C5D6) for body
- **Cards:** Dark gray (#1A2332) with subtle borders

**Why:** ARKCEL's purple accents + dark background feel premium. Our green + teal feels "hacker-y" (good for devs, bad for business buyers).

**Icons & Illustrations:**
- Add icons for process steps (Discovery = magnifying glass, Evidence Sprint = play button, Build = code brackets, Delivery = checkmark)
- Use illustrations for "How It Works" section (similar to ARKCEL's numbered timeline)
- Add subtle background patterns (topographic lines like ARKCEL, or circuit board pattern for tech feel)

**Product Screenshots:**
- Add screenshots of delivered projects (TherapyKin chat interface, La Serenissima dashboard)
- Show "Before/After" for Evidence Sprint demos
- Include code snippets with syntax highlighting (for technical proof without overwhelming)

**Whitespace:**
- Increase padding between sections (ARKCEL has generous spacing)
- Use full-width sections with contained content (like ARKCEL)
- Break long text blocks into bullet points with icons

**Owner:** Alexis (define requirements) → External designer (implement) OR Nicolas (if doing internally)
**Effort:** 2-3 days for mockups, 3-4 days for implementation
**Budget:** $300-500 if hiring designer (Fiverr/Upwork), $0 if Nicolas does it

---

#### 2.2 Restructure Content by Audience

**Current:** Single long page mixes marketing (hero), technical proof (commits), process (AC.md), pricing, FAQ.

**Problem:** Business buyers get lost in technical details. Developers can't find technical proof.

**Recommended Site Structure:**

**Homepage (Marketing-Focused):**
- Hero: Business-first messaging + multiple CTAs
- Trusted By: Client logos / anonymized case studies
- How It Works: 4-step business process (not technical AC.md details)
- What You Get: Benefits with icons (Speed, Quality, Transparency, Fixed Price)
- Pricing: High-level ranges ($400-1500 for creative AI, $200-600 for dev) with "Get Estimate" CTA
- FAQ: Business questions (What if I change my mind? How do you ensure quality? Do you offer support?)
- Contact: Simple form (name, email, project summary) + "Schedule Call" CTA

**Proof Log Page (Technical Proof):**
- All AC Green deliveries with demos, deltas, timestamps
- Commit feed (HUMAN vs AI)
- Performance metrics (Lighthouse scores, uptime, deployment frequency)
- Link from homepage: "See Our Work" CTA

**Process Page (Methodology Deep Dive):**
- Explain AC.md, Evidence Sprint, AC Green in detail
- Technical FAQ (What frameworks? What CI/CD? What testing?)
- For process-oriented clients who want to understand methodology

**Case Studies Page:**
- TherapyKin: AI companion with 121+ deployments
- La Serenissima: 97 agents, 99.7% uptime
- KinKong: $75K AUM trading bot
- Each with: Challenge → Solution → Results → Client quote (if possible)

**Owner:** Alexis (define structure) → Inna (write copy for new pages) → Whoever updates website (implement)
**Timeline:** 1 week for content, 3-5 days for implementation

---

#### 2.3 Add Collapsible FAQ (Like ARKCEL)

**Current:** FAQ is inline, long list of questions/answers (hard to scan).

**Recommended:** Collapsible accordion FAQ (click to expand).

**Business FAQ (Homepage):**
- What if my requirements change mid-project?
- How do you ensure quality?
- What if I don't like the Evidence Sprint demo?
- Do you offer support after delivery?
- What industries do you work with?
- How fast can you start?

**Technical FAQ (Process Page):**
- What tech stack do you use?
- How do you handle CI/CD?
- Do you write tests?
- Can you integrate with our existing systems?
- Do you provide documentation?

**Owner:** Alexis (draft questions) → Inna (write answers) → Whoever updates website (implement accordion)
**Timeline:** 3 days

---

### Tier 3: MEDIUM IMPACT, HIGH EFFORT (Week 3-4)

**These are "nice to have" but not urgent.**

#### 3.1 Add Client Testimonials

**What:** Short quotes from happy clients.

**Example:**
```
"ScopeLock delivered our MVP in 5 days. Other agencies quoted 6 weeks."
— Founder, AI Startup

"The Evidence Sprint saved us $20K. We realized the feature wouldn't work before building it."
— CTO, Healthcare Platform
```

**Owner:** Maya (request testimonials from past clients) → Alexis (draft placement) → Whoever updates website
**Timeline:** 2 weeks (depends on client response time)

---

#### 3.2 Create Case Study Videos (2-3 min)

**What:** Screen recording walkthroughs of delivered projects.

**Example:** "How We Built TherapyKin's AI Companion in 7 Days"
- Problem: Client needed AI companion with text + voice
- Solution: Next.js + FastAPI + ElevenLabs + Vercel/Render
- Demo: Show working product (chat, voice, memory)
- Results: 121+ deployments, 1.2M interactions

**Owner:** Alexis (define format) → Nicolas (record) OR External editor
**Timeline:** 1 week per video
**Budget:** $100-200 per video if outsourced

---

#### 3.3 SEO Optimization

**Current Issues:**
- Meta titles/descriptions not optimized for search
- No blog content (no organic traffic)
- Missing alt text on images

**Recommended:**

**Meta Tags:**
- Homepage: "Fixed-Price Software Development | Pay Only When Tests Pass | ScopeLock"
- Description: "AI-assisted software development with executable acceptance criteria. 2-7 day delivery. Fixed price. No scope creep. Trusted by 8+ startups."

**Blog Content (Emma's responsibility, tracked here for visibility):**
- 1 post/week on AI-assisted development, case studies, methodology
- Target keywords: "fixed price software development," "AI software agency," "no scope creep development"

**Alt Text:**
- Add descriptive alt text to all images/screenshots

**Owner:** Emma (blog content) → Alexis (meta tags) → Whoever updates website
**Timeline:** Ongoing (1 post/week)

---

## Success Metrics (How We'll Know It Worked)

**Conversion Metrics:**
- Proposal win rate: 15% → 30% (target)
- Homepage bounce rate: 60% → 40% (target)
- Average session duration: 1:30 → 3:00 (target)
- CTA click-through rate: 5% → 15% (target)

**Business Metrics:**
- Average project value: $400 → $800 (premium positioning)
- Time from first contact to contract signed: 5 days → 2 days (clearer value prop)
- Organic traffic: 0 → 100 visitors/month (SEO + blog)

**How to Track:**
- Google Analytics on website (track bounce rate, session duration, CTA clicks)
- Upwork proposal win rate (Emma tracks in leads-tracker.md)
- Client acquisition cost (marketing spend / new clients)

**Review Cadence:**
- Weekly during implementation (Alexis tracks progress in TODOS.md)
- Monthly after launch (Alexis publishes metrics in SYNC.md)

---

## Budget Estimate

**If doing internally (Nicolas + team):**
- $0 (just time investment)
- Estimated time: 40-60 hours total (Nicolas + Alexis + Inna + whoever implements)

**If outsourcing design:**
- Homepage redesign mockups: $300-500 (Fiverr/Upwork designer)
- Implementation: $500-800 (front-end developer)
- Case study videos: $100-200/video (video editor)
- **Total:** $900-1500 for full overhaul

**Recommendation:** Do Week 1 changes internally (just copy, no design), then decide if visual refresh is worth outsourcing based on Week 1 results.

---

## Risk Assessment

**Risk 1: "We lose our technical credibility by dumbing down messaging"**
- **Mitigation:** Keep technical proof (commits, AC.md, proof log) on separate pages. Don't remove it, just deprioritize on homepage.
- **Impact if we do nothing:** We keep attracting developers, not business buyers. Revenue stays low.

**Risk 2: "ARKCEL's style is generic, we'll lose our unique voice"**
- **Mitigation:** Keep ScopeLock's unique positioning (pay-only-when-tests-pass, Evidence Sprint) but explain it in business language.
- **Our advantage:** ARKCEL doesn't have our methodology. We just need to explain it better.

**Risk 3: "This takes time away from delivering client work"**
- **Mitigation:** Alexis drafts all copy, Inna reviews, Nicolas approves. Implementation is 1-2 days max for Week 1 changes.
- **ROI:** If win rate increases 15% → 30%, we 2x revenue. Worth 2 weeks of effort.

## Appendix: ARKCEL vs ScopeLock Side-by-Side

### Hero Section

**ARKCEL:**
```
H1: "Transform Ideas Into Market-Ready Digital Products."
Pitch: "From MVP to enterprise solutions. Trusted by startups and enterprises."
CTA: "Get Your Product Roadmap"
```

**ScopeLock (Current):**
```
H1: "Software locked to executable acceptance criteria"
Pitch: "I write tests with you, you pay only when tests pass. Solo engineer + AI team. 65k commits in 2024."
CTA: "Start with Evidence Sprint"
```

**ScopeLock (Recommended):**
```
H1: "Build the Right Product. Pay Only When It Works."
Pitch: "Fixed-price software development with AI-assisted delivery. 2-7 day delivery. No scope creep."
CTAs: "Get Free Estimate" | "See Our Work" | "Schedule Call"
```

---

### Process Explanation

**ARKCEL:**
```
1. Discovery & Planning
2. Design & Prototyping
3. Development & Testing
4. Deployment & Launch
5. Post-Launch Support
```

**ScopeLock (Current):**
```
1. Co-write AC.md
2. Evidence Sprint
3. AC Green
```

**ScopeLock (Recommended):**
```
1. Discovery & Planning (Day 1) - Write success criteria with you
2. Evidence Sprint (Days 2-3) - Build working demo, get approval
3. Build & Test (Days 4-7) - AI generates code, humans deploy
4. Delivery & Support (Day 8+) - Tests pass → you pay
```

---

### Social Proof

**ARKCEL:**
```
Client logos: SneakAR, Boxe, FICTRA, Perspective Journals, JECCOR
Text: "Trusted by startups scaling fast and established enterprises"
```

**ScopeLock (Current):**
```
Technical metrics: "65k commits in 2024"
Proof log: AC Green tags, commit feed
```

**ScopeLock (Recommended):**
```
Client logos: TherapyKin, KinKong, La Serenissima (if allowed)
OR anonymized: "Trusted by 8+ startups in AI, healthcare, fintech"
Metrics: "121+ deployments. 99.7% uptime."
```

---

## Decision: Approve or Revise?

**Alexis's Recommendation:** Approve Week 1 changes (low effort, high impact). Execute immediately.

**Questions for Nicolas:**
1. Can we use TherapyKin/KinKong/La Serenissima logos publicly? If not, use anonymized case studies.
2. Do you want to implement Week 1 changes yourself, or should we hire a developer?
3. For visual design refresh (Week 2), do you want to do it yourself or outsource to a designer ($300-500)?

**Next Steps:**
- Nicolas reviews this plan
- Alexis updates based on feedback
- Week 1 execution begins (copy rewrites, CTA additions)
- Track metrics weekly, adjust based on results
