# ScopeLock Strategic Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-07

## Current Phase: AI-Assisted Development Model

**Timeline:** 2025-11-01 → 2025-12-31 (2 months)
**Focus:** Prove AI-assisted junior developer model can deliver quality at speed

**Metrics:**
- Proposals sent: Current 0, Target 20/week by end of phase
- Win rate: Current 0%, Target 25% (5 jobs/week won)
- Missions delivered: Current 0, Target 8 in phase (4/month)
- Revenue: Current €0, Target €40K in phase
- Profit margin: Target 50%+ (€20K net)
- Runway: Target 6+ months by end of phase

---

## Phase 1: Solo Founder (Past)

**Timeline:** 2024-01 → 2025-10
**Focus:** High-value complex missions, Nicolas solo

- ✅ Built La Serenissima (97 agents, 99.7% uptime)
- ✅ Built TherapyKin (121+ deployments)
- ✅ Built KinKong ($75k$ AUM trading bot)
- ✅ Established ScopeLock methodology (AC Green, Evidence Sprint, Proof Log)

**Outcomes:**
- Proven technical depth
- Portfolio with social proof (Terminal Velocity 1.1k stars)
- ScopeLock framework validated
- Revenue: High per-mission (€5-10K), low volume (1-2/month)

**Lesson:** Not scalable solo. Need team to increase volume.

## Phase 2: AI-Assisted Development Model (Current)

**Timeline:** 2025-11-01 → 2025-12-31
**Status:** In Progress (Week 1)

**Goals:**
- [ ] Hire 2-3 junior developers (Nigeria/Côte d'Ivoire)
- [ ] Deliver 8 missions using AI-generated code + human supervision
- [ ] Achieve 25% proposal win rate (5/week won from 20/week sent)
- [ ] Maintain 50%+ profit margin
- [ ] Build 6 months runway

**Success criteria:**
- Junior developers can deploy AI-generated code independently after 3 missions
- Client satisfaction remains high (no complaints, payment at AC Green)
- Quality maintained (Sofia QA pass rate >90%)
- Proposal → delivery time <2 weeks average

**Current Status (2025-11-07):**
- Team structure defined ✅
- AI citizens created (Emma, Inna, Rafael, Sofia, Alexis, Maya) ✅
- Standard tech stack defined (Next.js + Vercel, Python + Render) ✅
- **STRATEGIC PIVOT #1 ✅ (2025-11-07 AM):** Creative AI services prioritized over traditional dev
  - 7 new service categories added (Gamma, ElevenLabs, Ideogram, Runway, Suno, translation, content)
  - Target margins: 70-85% (vs 50-60% for traditional dev)
  - Competitive moat: Dev shops can't compete (no AI creative tools access)
  - Week 1 targets revised: $400-1100 revenue (vs $250-800 previously)
- **STRATEGIC PIVOT #2 ✅ (2025-11-07 PM):** New mission compensation system
  - **Flexible roles:** Anyone can work on anything (no more dedicated roles)
  - **Pay per interaction:** Every message to AI = +1 point, earn % of 30% team pool
  - **Gamified earnings:** Real-time display of potential earnings per job/mission
  - **Jobs vs Missions:** Jobs = Upwork client work, Missions = internal work (proposals, social, recruitment)
  - **Mission pricing:** Write proposal $1, recruit $10, post on X $2
  - **Team gets 35% total:** 30% pool (split by interactions) + 5% mission fund
  - **Spec created:** `/docs/mission-compensation-system.md` (awaiting Inna's detailed docs)
- Human team: Bigbosexf, Reanance, Kara (now flexible, not dedicated roles)
- First proposals: 0 sent (Emma ready to hunt creative AI jobs)

**Blockers:**
- Need to activate Emma to start sending proposals (prioritize creative AI services)
- Need to test full workflow (proposal → delivery) at least once
- Verify access to creative AI tools (Ideogram, Runway, Suno, ElevenLabs, Gamma)
- **NEW:** Implement mission compensation system in Mission Deck (Inna → Rafael → Developer)

---

## Phase 3: Scale to 5-10 Developers

**Planned start:** 2026-01-01
**Duration:** 3 months

**Prerequisites:**
- Phase 2 goals achieved (8 missions delivered, 50% margin, 6 months runway)
- Workflow proven (proposal → Inna → Rafael → developer → Sofia → AC Green)
- At least 2 developers performing independently

**Goals:**
- Hire 3-5 more junior developers
- Increase to 10-20 simultaneous missions
- Revenue: €100K+ per month
- Profit: €50K+ per month
- Establish lead developer role (promote best performer)

**Success criteria:**
- 10+ simultaneous missions without quality degradation
- Win rate maintained at 25%+
- Profit margin maintained at 50%+
- Developer retention >80% (low turnover)

---

## Phase 4: Market Expansion (Future)

**Planned start:** 2026-04-01

**Prerequisites:**
- 5-10 developers performing well
- Revenue stable at €100K+/month
- Team management systems proven

**Goals:**
- Expand to new verticals (healthcare, fintech, AI infrastructure)
- Add retainer model (monthly ongoing work)
- Geographic expansion (EU market, US market)
- Partner channel (agencies white-labeling ScopeLock)

**Unknowns to resolve:**
- Which verticals are most profitable?
- Which geographic markets have best demand/price ratio?
- Can we maintain quality at 20+ simultaneous missions?

---

## Future Opportunities (Not Yet Scheduled)

**Service Offerings:**
- Monthly retainers for ongoing development (predictable revenue)
- "Evidence Sprint only" product (€2-3K for demo + delta, no full build)
- White-label ScopeLock for agencies (licensing model)
- AI consulting/training (teach other agencies AI-assisted workflow)

**Market Expansion:**
- Healthcare (HIPAA-compliant, therapy, wellness)
- Fintech (trading, payments, banking)
- AI infrastructure (protocols, frameworks, multi-agent)
- Enterprise automation (internal tools, workflow automation)

**Team Growth:**
- Hire lead developer (supervise 5-10 junior devs)
- Hire client success manager (Maya role, human)
- Add specialized developers (mobile, blockchain, ML)

**Technology:**
- Build internal ScopeLock platform (automate Inna specs, Rafael code gen, Sofia QA)
- Contribute to open source (Terminal Velocity, Mind Protocol)
- Build public API for ScopeLock methodology (other agencies can integrate)

## Strategic Principles (Constant Across All Phases)

1. **Quality over volume:** AC Green is non-negotiable, never ship broken code
2. **AI does heavy lifting, humans supervise:** 95% AI work, 5% human review
3. **Transparent pricing:** Scope locked, pay at AC Green, Swap/Add for changes
4. **Proof-driven:** Public proof log, demos, quantified deltas
5. **Sustainable margins:** 50%+ profit margin, never race to bottom on price
6. **Developer empowerment:** Junior devs learn and grow, not just code monkeys
7. **Standard stack:** Next.js + Vercel, Python + Render unless client constraints
