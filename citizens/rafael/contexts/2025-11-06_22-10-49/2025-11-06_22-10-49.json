You just supervise. Earn commission on every mission clients accept.\n\nHow It Works\nAI does 95% of the work. You supervise, deploy, and get paid.\n\n👤\nYou\nFind job\nEmma\nEmma\nWrite proposal\n👤\nYou\nSubmit\nInna\nInna\nWrite specs\n👤\nYou\nLock scope\nRafael\nRafael\nGenerate code\n👤\nYou\nDeploy\nSofia\nSofia\nQA checklist\n👤\nYou\nTest\nMaya\nMaya\nDemo script\n👤\nYou\nPresent\n✅\nClient accepts\nYou get paid\nRequirements\n✓\nUnderstand English — Read documentation, write clear messages to clients\n✓\nFollow step-by-step project guides — Deployment guides, testing checklists\n✓\n5-30 hours per week — Flexible schedule, work when you want\n✓\nWillingness to learn — AI teaches you by showing you working code\nWhat You Can Expect\nYou earn commission on every mission.

You're never alone—if you get stuck, ask in the team chat and someone will help.\nHow is this different from just using ChatGPT?\nOur AI partners do 95% of the work, and 100% of the coding and writing. You just supervise. ChatGPT gives you code. We give you: proposal writing, client management, QA testing, deployment guides, and 5 specialized AI citizens who know the ScopeLock workflow.\nDo I need to know how to code?\nNo. Rafael writes 100% of the code. You copy-paste, deploy, and test. If something breaks, Rafael fixes it.\nWhat if the client doesn't pay?\nUpwork escrow protects you. Client must fund before work starts. You only get paid when client pays, but clients can't run off without paying through Upwork.\nReady to Start?\nMessage Nicolas on Telegram.

ScopeLock\nWe co-write AC.md with you. Scope locked, price fixed.\n\n[ ]\n→\n2. Evidence Sprint\nWorking demo ≤90s + quantified delta. You see it before committing to full build.\n\n[●]\n→\n3. AC Green\nAcceptance tests pass in CI. You pay only when tests are green.\n\n[✓]\nWhat's The Catch?\n\"Pay only when tests pass\" sounds too good. Here's how it actually works:\n\nWhat if tests pass but it's still broken?\nTests were wrong—I fix at no charge. But if tests correctly verify original criteria and you want new criteria, that's a scope change.\n\nWhat if I'm unreasonable and keep saying \"not good enough\"?\nAcceptance criteria are executable tests in code, not subjective judgment. If tests pass, milestone is done. Want to change criteria? That's a Change Request.\n\nWhat if we discover the scope was wrong?\nChange Request: document what changed, Swap ($0) or Add (new price), you approve first. No surprise invoices.\n\nHow do you prevent infinite revisions?\nAC.md includes exact test command + seed data. When CI is green, you can verify yourself. Done means done.\n\nYou'll know if we're good before you pay.\n\nTransparent Pricing\nEvidence Sprint\n$3,000 - $6,000\n\n2-5 days\n\n✓ Working demo (≤90s)\n✓ Quantified delta (DELTA.md)\n✓ Decision: build full or pivot\nMOST POPULAR\nScopeLock Mission\n$8,000 - $15,000\n\n1-3 weeks\n\n✓ Co-written AC.md\n✓ Executable acceptance tests\n✓ Pay only at AC green\n✓ Proof log entry\nMulti-Milestone\n$25,000+\n\n1-3 months\n\n✓ Multiple AC green milestones\n✓ Change control (Swap/Add)\n✓ Dedicated timeline\nFinal price fixed upfront. No hourly rates, no surprises.\n\nAbout Me\nI'm Nicolas, a solo developer who ships fast.\n\nI've built AI companion platforms (121+ deployments), trading bots ($75K AUM), and multi-agent systems (97 agents, 99.7% uptime). My open-source CLI tool has 1,051 GitHub stars (top 0.01% of GitHub).\n\nI use AI to speed up delivery without compromising quality. What used to take agencies 4 weeks, I deliver in 4 days. You get professional work at fair prices.\n\nLinks:\n\n→ GitHub (Personal) — 65K commits in 2024, 37 repos\n→ GitHub (Organization) — 23 repos, Terminal Velocity (1.1k stars)\nNo agencies. No teams. Just me + AI-assisted workflow.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow fast can you deliver?\nWhat if I don't like the result?\nDo you work with agencies or outsource the work?\nWhat's your pricing model?\nCan you start immediately?\nDo you sign NDAs?\nWhat if my project is larger than your typical scope?\nNot a Good Fit If...\n✗ You need someone full-time (I work on milestones, not retainers)\n✗ You want hourly billing (I only do fixed-price)\n✗ Scope is undefined (\"just start building, we'll figure it out\")\n✗ You need hardware, blockchain, or WordPress customization\nGood fit: Web development, AI chatbots, creative AI services (presentations, voice, content), backend APIs.\n\nContact\nStart within 24-48 hours. Tell me what you need and I'll send you a fixed price + timeline. No obligation.\n\nRequest an Evidence Sprint — I'll build a 90-second demo to prove the concept works before you commit to the full build.\n\nName\nYour name\nEmail\nyour@email.com\nWhat do you want to see working in 90 seconds?\nExample: 'User signs up with email, receives OTP code, logs in successfully'\nWhat problem does this solve?\nExample: 'Current signup takes 7 steps, we're losing 60% of users'\nTimeline\nExample: 'Need in 1 week'\nBudget Range\nExample: '$300-600'\nRequest Evidence Sprint\nPrefer to book directly?\n\nBook 30min kickoff\nscopelock@mindprotocol.ai\n© ScopeLock — membrane-first, event-native.
