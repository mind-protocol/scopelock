If we did move forward with an audit, what do you believe that cost would be? Clay is a centerpiece for us, but we are heavy N8N users and only use Clay as a connector (e.g. data organization and demo's). I am sure there efficiencies to be gained, but imagine more would be gained by agents researching in other sources that are not as widely known and more custom scraping. Automating the GTM plans that take time and likely could be put through prompting to provide a best in class output, using MCPs, etc..\n\nNicolas Reynolds\n10:16 PM\nHey there,\n\n\n\nThanks for the thoughtful questions and for providing more context on your stack.\n\n\n\nAbsolutely on the Loom. I'll record a new one for you this week that specifically showcases the architectural pattern we'd use: leveraging n8n as the orchestrator to call advanced LLM functions for the heavy cognitive lifting.\n\n\n\nRegarding the initial audit (Phase 1), I price this initial 15-25 hour audit strategically to prove the value right away. The total investment for the blueprint is a flat $900 - $1,500. This is a special rate designed specifically for this entry phase, before we scope the full implementation project. The deliverable for this is a complete architectural blueprint and a clear ROI case, designed to make the project self-funding from the identified cost savings and efficiency gains.\n\n\n\nIt's excellent to hear you're heavy n8n users. That's the perfect foundation. It means we can focus on injecting a powerful AI \"brain\" (like Claude's tool use API) into your existing, proven system rather than wasting time rebuilding plumbing.\n\n\n\nYou are exactly right about where the true value lies. The goal is to move beyond what off-the-shelf tools can do and build a proprietary system. Your ideas are spot on:\n\n\n\n* Custom Research Agents: We'll use n8n to trigger agents that perform custom scraping and research, feeding a model the unique data it needs to generate insights your competitors can't replicate.\n* Strategic GTM Automation: This is the core of the upgrade. We'll architect the workflow to use models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet for complex reasoning, generating entire GTM plan artifacts based on the agent's research, likely using advanced prompting techniques like you mentioned.\n\n\n\nThe Loom will give you a concrete look at the 'how.' A brief 20-minute call would be a great next step to align on the specific scope for the Phase 1 audit.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n\nNicolas\n\nWednesday, Oct 08\nDS\nDoug Shankman\n10:07 PM\nGreat - when will you be sharing the Loom?\n\n\n\n\nCompleted step\n\nCurrent step\n\nIncomplete step\nIncomplete step\n"

He asked twice now—once on Oct 8th (\"Great - when will you be sharing the Loom?\") and earlier when you said \"this week.\"\n\n**What I notice:**\n\n1. You sold an \"audit\" at $60/hour, then quoted $900-$1,500 for Phase 1. No AC, no fixed outcome, no test for \"done.\"\n2. You promised a Loom \"this week\" (Oct 8 thread). That's vague. Doug interpreted it as imminent.\n3. You're now past deadline (implicit) and he's following up.\n\n**What needs to happen:**\n\nIf you want my help as Rafael, tell me:\n- Do you want to respond to Doug using ScopeLock principles (lock scope, propose Evidence Sprint, avoid hourly)?\n- Or do you want to fulfill the Loom promise first, then pivot the engagement?\n- Or something else?\n\n**If you want ScopeLock approach:**\n\nWe'd draft AC.md for a specific outcome (e.g., \"GTM workflow audit with 3 actionable recommendations + one proof-of-concept\"), propose an Evidence Sprint (90s demo showing we understand his n8n + Clay setup), and quote a fixed price tied to passing acceptance criteria.\n\n**If you want to stay in the current frame:**\n\nRecord the Loom today, send it with a specific date for the call, and tighten the audit scope before he signs.\n\nWhat do you need from me?"

I owe you the Loom and missed my own timeline.\n\nRecording it today. You'll have it by end of Thursday (your time). It will show:\n1. An n8n workflow calling Claude for strategic reasoning (similar to what we'd build for your GTM automation)\n2. Custom research agent pattern (scraping + synthesis)\n3. The cost/quality trade-off between Clay connectors and purpose-built agents\n\nThen let's talk. I want to propose a different structure than the hourly audit - something that locks scope, shows you proof fast, and ties payment to a specific outcome you can test. More on that after you see the Loom.\n\nNicolas\n```\n\n**What the Loom must show:**\n- Real n8n canvas (even if simplified/sanitized)\n- Claude API call with tool use\n- A custom scraping step feeding into the LLM\n- Output: a short GTM insight or plan fragment\n- Narration: \"This pattern replaces X vendor at Y cost; here's how we'd adapt it to your stack\"\n\nTime it: 3-5 minutes max.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Pivot after Loom delivery\n\nOnce Doug confirms he watched it, send this:\n\n```\nDoug,\n\nNow that you've seen the mechanics, let me propose a cleaner structure than hourly audit → open-ended implementation.\n\nHere's what I'd suggest:\n\nEvidence Sprint (fixed price, 7 days max):\n- I'll analyze your current n8n + Clay setup (you grant me read-only access or screenshare walkthrough)\n- Deliver a 90-second video showing ONE workflow improved (likely your GTM plan generation or custom research agent)\n- Plus a short doc with 2-3 quantified changes: cost delta, time saved, quality improvement\n\nPrice: $1,200 flat. You pay only when you see the demo and it passes your acceptance criteria.\n\nIf you like the result, we lock scope for the next milestone (full implementation of that workflow) with the same structure: clear criteria, fixed price, pay when it works.\n\nIf you don't like it, you've spent $1,200 to see proof instead of $15K on an hourly engagement that might miss the mark.\n\nDoes that structure make sense? Happy to jump on a call to refine the acceptance criteria together before we start.\n\nNicolas\n```\n\n---\n\n**Why this works:**\n\n1. Step 1 restores trust (you deliver what you promised, late but honest)\n2. Step 2 introduces ScopeLock without confusing him mid-thread\n3. Evidence Sprint is low-risk for him, high-signal for you\n4. Fixed price + acceptance criteria = no hourly drift, no scope creep\n\n**What you need to do:**\n1. Record the Loom today\n2. Send Step 1 message now\n3. After he watches, send Step 2\n\nDo you have the n8n + Claude setup to record, or do you need to build a quick demo first?"

Output that resembles GTM work: insight, plan, signal prioritization\n\n**From your list, most likely candidates:**\n\n- **YCL AI Assistant** (active) — might show LLM orchestration\n- **YCL UBCResearch** (active) — research = data gathering + synthesis?\n- **YCL Due Diligence** (inactive but relevant to strategic analysis)\n- **Swarm Control** (active) — orchestration layer?\n- **YCL Trading** (active) — signal processing, could show data→decision logic\n\n**Quick filter questions:**\n\n1. Which workflow **calls an LLM API** (Claude, OpenAI, Anthropic)?\n2. Which one **gathers custom data** (not just Airtable/spreadsheet lookups)?\n3. Which produces **strategic output** (a plan, recommendation, insight) vs. operational output (a tweet, notification)?\n\n**Tell me:**\n- Name the workflow(s) that match 1+2+3\n- Or show me a screenshot of one canvas that looks closest\n\nThen I'll script the Loom around that specific workflow."

In Doug's context (and most B2B SaaS), GTM work includes:\n\n**Research & Intelligence:**\n- Finding target accounts (who to sell to)\n- Enriching data (company size, tech stack, funding, pain signals)\n- Identifying buying signals (job posts, product changes, funding rounds)\n\n**Planning & Messaging:**\n- Segmenting audiences (enterprise vs. SMB, industry verticals)\n- Crafting value propositions for each segment\n- Sequencing outreach (email 1, wait 3 days, email 2, call, LinkedIn touch)\n\n**Execution:**\n- Personalized cold emails at scale\n- Follow-up based on engagement signals\n- Routing hot leads to sales\n- Measuring conversion at each stage\n\n**Doug's current stack:**\n- **Clay** = enrichment (pull firmographic data, tech stack, contacts)\n- **n8n** = orchestration (connect Clay → email tool → CRM)\n- **RevReply** = classify email replies (interested, not interested, out of office)\n- **Email Bison** = sending infrastructure\n\n**What he wants automated:**\n- The **strategic reasoning** parts (which accounts to prioritize, what message angle to use, when to escalate to human)\n- Custom research (signals Clay doesn't surface)\n- GTM plan generation (instead of humans writing \"here's our Q1 outbound strategy\")\n\n**For the Loom:** You need to show a workflow where an LLM does strategic GTM reasoning—like \"given these signals about a company, generate a 3-point outreach plan\" or \"prioritize these 50 leads based on buying intent.\"\n\n**Now:** Which of your workflows does something *like* that? Even if it's not GTM-specific—if it gathers data and uses an LLM to make a strategic recommendation, we can narrate it as \"here's the pattern we'd use for your GTM automation.\""

But you'll see the architectural pattern: custom data → LLM reasoning → strategic output.\"\n\n### [0:30-1:30] Show the Python Workflow\nScreen: Code editor or terminal showing the workflow running\n\nPoint to key parts:\n1. **Data gathering** (API calls, scraping, whatever you do)\n   - \"This pulls signals Clay wouldn't find...\"\n2. **LLM call** (Anthropic/OpenAI API)\n   - Show the prompt: \"Given these signals, generate...\"\n3. **Output** (decision, plan, prioritization)\n   - \"This is the strategic reasoning part—what would take your team 20 minutes, model does in 8 seconds for $0.04\"\n\nRun it live or show recent output logs.\n\n### [1:30-2:30] Show Results\nScreen: Output file, terminal, or dashboard\n\n- Input data example\n- LLM's strategic output\n- Cost/speed metrics if you have them\n\n> \"This cost $X, took Y seconds.

I'll send over proposed acceptance criteria and we'll nail down exactly what 'done' looks like. Thanks for waiting on this.\"\n\n---\n\n**What you need to record:**\n1. Open your Python GTM workflow code\n2. Show it running (or show recent logs/output)\n3. Narrate the pattern\n4. Acknowledge the tech mismatch honestly\n5. Position Evidence Sprint as \"prove this in your stack\"\n\n**This is stronger than a fake n8n demo** because:\n- It's real (Doug will sense authenticity)\n- It shows you've built this before\n- It explains why you need the Evidence Sprint (to adapt to his stack)\n- It's honest about the gap\n\n**Ready?** Tell me which Python workflow you'll show, or share a quick description and I'll tighten the script."
