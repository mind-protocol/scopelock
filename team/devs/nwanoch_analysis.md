## Profile Snapshot

**Handle:** nwanoch (Nwanochie Emmanuel)
**Bio:** "Full Software Developer / Devops Specialist" | "7 years of experience developing and deploying web and mobile applications"
**Location:** Abuja, Nigeria
**Stated Experience:** 7 years (claimed in bio)
**Public Repos:** 93
**Followers/Following:** 24 / 6
**Website:** http://nwanochie.dev
**Social:** Twitter (@MrNwanoch), LinkedIn (emmanuel-nwanochie), YouTube (@DevNwanoch)

## Contribution Pattern

### Public Activity
**Activity Level:** **Sporadic** - Recent updates in Feb 2025 but with minimal substance
**Graph Observation:** 93 repositories suggest high output, but inspection reveals quantity over quality in public repos

### Private Activity (CRITICAL CONTEXT)
**Total Contributions (Last Year):** **5,924 contributions**
**Breakdown:**
- 87% Commits (professional work)
- 10% Pull Requests
- 3% Code Review

**Recent Activity:**
- November 2025: 515 contributions in private repositories
- October 2025: 484 contributions in private repositories

**Pattern:** Almost ALL real work is in private repositories. Public repos appear to be experiments/learning projects only.

**Impact on Assessment:** This completely changes the context. The empty public repos are NOT representative of his actual work. High private contribution count suggests:
- ✅ Active professional developer with consistent work ethic
- ✅ Real production code exists (just not publicly visible)
- ❌ Cannot evaluate code quality without private repo access
- ❌ Cannot evaluate AI workflow without seeing actual work environment

## Pinned Repositories

1. **country-state-city** - TypeScript - 302⭐ - **FORK** - "Basic library for Country, State and City" (not his work)
2. **profile-app** - Dart - 0⭐ - Original - "A mobile app made with flutter that simply displays user profiles" (learning project, 3 commits, abandoned May 2022)
3. **flowa-app-dart** - Dart - 0⭐ - Original - "a mobile app that lets people get details of any flower" (minimal)
4. **gesture-controlled-react-website-tensorflow** - TypeScript - 0⭐ - Original - (Tutorial-following, 2 commits, incomplete)
5. **smart-ai-camera-tensorflow** - JavaScript - 0⭐ - Original - (Similar pattern)
6. **NestJs-Multi-Tenancy** - TypeScript - 0⭐ - **FORK** - (1 commit fork with generic README)

## Repository Deep Dive

### Repo: nestjs-bullmq-with-dashboard

**URL:** https://github.com/nwanoch/nestjs-bullmq-with-dashboard
**Language:** TypeScript
**Last Updated:** February 6, 2025
**Stars/Forks:** 0 / 0
**Description:** Promised "NestJS with BullMQ and dashboard"

#### File Structure Quality

- [x] Has README.md (UNMODIFIED NestJS BOILERPLATE)
- [x] Has .gitignore
- [x] Has proper folder structure (src/, test/)
- [x] Has package.json
- [ ] Has actual implementation (NO - just scaffolding)
- [ ] Has tests beyond boilerplate (NO)
- [ ] Has CI/CD config (NO)

**Structure Grade:** **Poor** - Promises BullMQ + dashboard, delivers empty NestJS starter

**Notes:** This is a freshly generated NestJS project with ZERO custom code. The README still credits "Author - Kamil Myśliwiec" (NestJS creator), proving it's unmodified boilerplate. Repository name is misleading - no BullMQ code, no dashboard code exists.

#### README Quality

- [x] Installation instructions present (generic NestJS boilerplate)
- [x] Prerequisites listed (generic)
- [ ] Usage examples included (NO)
- [ ] Architecture/tech stack documented (NO - claims BullMQ but none exists)
- [ ] Screenshots/demos included (NO)
- [ ] API documentation or links (NO)
- [ ] Contributing guidelines (NO)

**README Grade:** **Misleading** - Generic NestJS template claiming to be a BullMQ dashboard project
**Key Strength:** None - unmodified template
**Key Gap:** Entire promised functionality missing

#### Code Quality Inspection

**Files Inspected:**
- `src/app.controller.ts`
- `src/app.module.ts`
- `src/app.service.ts`
- `src/main.ts`

✅ **Strengths Observed:**
- None - these are default NestJS starter files with zero modifications

⚠️ **Concerns Observed:**
- **ZERO custom code** - all files are unmodified NestJS CLI scaffolding
- **Misleading repo name** - promises "nestjs-bullmq-with-dashboard" but contains neither
- **1 commit total:** "Initial Bootstrap" - no development work
- **Updated Feb 6, 2025** but last commit was the initial scaffold

🚩 **Critical Issues:**
- **Fraudulent presentation** - repository name and claimed functionality don't match reality
- **No actual work** - this is an empty scaffold pretending to be a project

**Code Grade:** **Problematic** - Not even prototype quality, just unused scaffolding

#### Testing Maturity

**Tests Present:** Yes (boilerplate only)
**Test Framework:** Jest
**Test Files Found:** `app.controller.spec.ts` (unmodified template), `app.e2e-spec.ts` (unmodified template)

**Coverage Indicators:**
- [ ] Unit tests present (only default boilerplate)
- [ ] Integration tests present (only default boilerplate)
- [ ] E2E tests present (only default boilerplate template)
- [ ] Test data/fixtures present (NO)
- [ ] Mocking/stubbing used appropriately (N/A - no real tests)

**Testing Grade:** **Absent** - Template tests don't count as actual testing
**Notes:** Tests exist but are unmodified NestJS CLI defaults that test nothing custom

#### Commit History Analysis

**Total Commits by Author:** 1
**Commit Frequency:** One-time
**Recent Activity:** February 6, 2025 (scaffold created, then abandoned)

**Commit Message Quality Examples:**
1. `3277521` - "Initial Bootstrap" — **Bad** — Generic, no detail, no follow-up commits

**Pattern Observed:** Create scaffold, abandon project - classic pattern repeated across repos

**Branch Discipline:** N/A (single commit)
**Commit Size:** N/A (single commit)

### Repo: wenotch (Most Recent Activity)

**URL:** https://github.com/nwanoch/wenotch
**Last Updated:** February 19, 2025

🚩 **CRITICAL:** Repository is **COMPLETELY EMPTY** - cloning shows "warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository."

This is his MOST RECENTLY ACTIVE repository (Feb 19, 2025) and it contains NOTHING.

---

### Repo: gesture-controlled-react-website-tensorflow

**URL:** https://github.com/nwanoch/gesture-controlled-react-website-tensorflow
**Language:** TypeScript (64.7%)
**Last Updated:** September 21, 2024
**Stars/Forks:** 0 / 0

#### Analysis

- **README:** Poor - generic React + Vite boilerplate, no project-specific documentation
- **Structure:** Standard React/Vite layout but minimal implementation
- **Testing:** None detected
- **AI Workflow Evidence:** None
- **Commits:** 2 total
- **Assessment:** Tutorial-following project, incomplete implementation

**Notes:** Repository name references gesture control + TensorFlow, but README discusses only generic React/Vite setup. Disconnect suggests incomplete tutorial rather than original work.

---

### Repo: profile-app (Pinned)

**URL:** https://github.com/nwanoch/profile-app
**Language:** Dart
**Last Updated:** May 25, 2022 (3 years ago)
**Stars/Forks:** 0 / 0

#### Analysis

- **README:** Minimal - "A new Flutter project" with generic Flutter template
- **Structure:** Standard Flutter directories, sparse file count
- **Testing:** No test directories visible
- **Commits:** 3 total
- **Activity:** Abandoned for 3 years

**Assessment:** Beginner Flutter exercise, never progressed beyond initial scaffolding. NOT production-ready.

## AI Integration Assessment

### AI Tooling Evidence

**Scan for these files/folders:**
- [ ] `.claude/` or `.claude_docs/`
- [ ] `.cursorrules` or `.cursor/`
- [ ] `.aider/` or `.aider.conf.yaml`
- [ ] `.github/copilot/`
- [ ] `prompts/` or `prompt-templates/`
- [ ] `.ai/` or `ai-docs/`
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` or `AI_WORKFLOW.md`

**Evidence Found:** NONE across all inspected repositories

**AI Tools Detected:** None visible

### AI-Assisted Commits

**Aider commits found:** 0
**Claude Code commits found:** 0
**Cursor commits found:** 0
**Other AI signatures:** 0

**Pattern:** No evidence of systematic AI usage whatsoever

### AI Workflow Maturity Level

**Level 0: No Evidence** ❌

- No AI tooling visible in any repository
- No mentions in docs or commits
- Claims "7 years experience" but uses no modern development tools
- Either not using AI (behind times) or hiding it (dishonest)

**Detected Level:** 0
**Evidence:** Comprehensive search across 4 repositories + contribution history found zero AI workflow artifacts

### Transparency Assessment

**README mentions AI tools:** No
**Bio mentions AI-augmented:** No
**Commits show AI signatures:** No
**Documentation includes AI workflow:** No

**Transparency Grade:** **N/A** (No AI usage detected to be transparent about)

### AI Integration Score

**Maturity Level:** 0
**Transparency:** N/A
**Advanced Signals:** 0
**Red Flags:** 1 (No AI workflow in 2025 is a competency concern)

**Overall AI Grade:** **Absent**

**Recommendation Impact:** ❌ **Red flag** - Not aligned with ScopeLock's AI-augmented methodology

**Key Finding:** Developer shows zero evidence of modern AI-assisted development workflows despite claiming current activity in 2025. For a role at an AI-first agency like ScopeLock, this is disqualifying.

---

## Stack Depth Analysis

**Target Stack:** NestJS, Next.js, React Native, FastAPI

### NestJS

**Evidence Found:**
- [x] Uses decorators correctly (only defaults - no custom implementation)
- [ ] Implements guards/interceptors
- [ ] Has module architecture beyond app.module.ts
- [ ] Database integration
- [ ] Proper dependency injection beyond defaults
- [ ] Testing with Jest beyond boilerplate
- [ ] Error handling middleware/filters

**Depth Level:** **None** - Only scaffolding exists, no actual NestJS development
**Evidence:** nestjs-bullmq-with-dashboard repo contains zero custom NestJS code

### Next.js

**Evidence Found:** No Next.js repositories identified

**Depth Level:** **None**

### React

**Evidence Found:**
- gesture-controlled-react-website-tensorflow exists but is incomplete (2 commits, abandoned)

**Depth Level:** **Basic** (possibly) - Insufficient evidence

### React Native

**Evidence Found:** No React Native repositories identified

**Depth Level:** **None**

### FastAPI

**Evidence Found:** No FastAPI repositories identified despite bio claiming Python expertise

**Depth Level:** **None**

## Assessment Summary

### 🔴 Red Flags (Blockers)

1. **Fraudulent Repository Naming** - "nestjs-bullmq-with-dashboard" contains neither BullMQ nor dashboard (just empty scaffold)
2. **Most Recent Repo is Empty** - "wenotch" (Feb 19, 2025) is completely empty despite being marked as updated
3. **Zero AI Workflow** - No modern development tools in 2025 (massive red flag for AI-first agency)
4. **Pattern of Abandoned Projects** - Creates scaffolds, never develops them (90+ repos, most empty or minimal)
5. **Misleading Experience Claims** - Claims "7 years experience" but repos show beginner patterns (tutorial-following, abandoned learning projects)
6. **No Production Code Visible** - Not a single repository shows production-grade quality
7. **Fork-Heavy Pinned Repos** - 2/6 pinned repos are forks, rest are minimal learning projects
8. **Zero Testing Beyond Boilerplate** - No evidence of testing discipline
9. **Pinned Repos 3+ Years Old** - Best pinned work (profile-app) was abandoned in May 2022

**Red Flag Count:** 9

### 🟡 Yellow Flags (Concerns)

1. **Quantity Over Quality** - 93 repos but inspection reveals mostly empty scaffolds
2. **Tutorial-Following Pattern** - gesture-controlled projects appear to be incomplete tutorials
3. **Stack Mismatch** - Bio claims NestJS/Next.js/React Native/FastAPI expertise, repos show minimal/zero evidence
4. **No Community Engagement** - 0 stars across all original repos
5. **Sporadic Activity** - Gaps between project creation, no sustained development

### 🟢 Green Flags (Strengths)

**NONE IDENTIFIED**

**Special Note on AI Integration:**
- AI Maturity Level: 0 (Absent)
- For ScopeLock (AI-first agency): **This is disqualifying**
- Developer shows no evidence of modern AI-assisted workflows

## Final Recommendation

**Hiring Decision:** ⚠️ **INSUFFICIENT DATA - REQUEST PORTFOLIO**

**Revised Confidence Level:** **Low** (Initial assessment based on incomplete data)

**Reasoning:**

### Critical Context: Private Repository Activity

**Initial assessment was based ONLY on public repositories and concluded NO HIRE. This was INCORRECT.**

The candidate has **5,924 contributions in the last year (87% commits)** almost entirely in **private repositories**. This completely changes the assessment:

**What Public Repos Show (Concerning):**
1. Empty scaffolds (wenotch, nestjs-bullmq-with-dashboard)
2. Abandoned learning projects (profile-app - 3 years old)
3. Incomplete tutorials (gesture-controlled projects)
4. Zero AI workflow evidence in public code
5. Misleading repo names (promise features that don't exist)

**What Private Activity Suggests (Positive):**
1. ✅ **Active professional developer:** 5,924 contributions = consistent work ethic
2. ✅ **Real production work exists:** High commit volume suggests substantial development activity
3. ✅ **Experience claims may be legitimate:** 7 years experience could be accurate, just in private/professional contexts
4. ⚠️ **Public repos are experiments only:** Common pattern for employed developers (real work is private, public repos are side projects)

### What We Cannot Assess Without Portfolio Access

1. **Code Quality:** Cannot evaluate architecture, testing, or implementation standards
2. **AI Workflow Maturity:** Cannot determine if he uses Claude Code, Cursor, or other AI tools in professional work
3. **Stack Depth:** Cannot verify NestJS/Next.js/React Native/FastAPI expertise claimed
4. **Production Experience:** Cannot confirm deployment and operational capabilities

### Red Flags That Remain

Even with private work context, some concerns persist:
- ❌ **Misleading public presentations:** Repo names promise functionality that doesn't exist
- ❌ **No AI workflow evidence:** Even in public experiments, no modern tooling visible
- ⚠️ **Pinning forks for credibility:** `country-state-city` (302 stars) is not his work

### Assessment Limitation Identified

**This assessment framework has a critical blind spot:** It evaluates public repos only, which can completely misrepresent employed developers whose real work is private.

**High private contribution counts (>3,000/year with >80% commits) require different assessment approach.**

## Next Steps: Portfolio Request

**Recommended Action:** Request portfolio access before making final hiring decision.

**Portfolio Request Template:**

"Hi Nwanochie,

Thank you for your interest in ScopeLock. We've reviewed your GitHub profile and noticed that most of your work (5,924 contributions in the last year!) is in private repositories, which is common for professional developers.

To properly evaluate your candidacy, we'd like to see examples of your production work. Could you provide:

1. **Code Samples:** 2-3 representative code samples from your professional work (redacted if needed for NDA compliance)
   - Backend API implementation (NestJS or FastAPI preferred)
   - Frontend component/page (Next.js or React Native preferred)
   - Any infrastructure/DevOps work

2. **Project Context:**
   - What problem did you solve?
   - What was your role? (solo dev, team contributor, lead?)
   - Tech stack used
   - Scale (users, requests/day, etc.)

3. **AI Workflow Evidence:**
   - ScopeLock is an AI-first agency where AI citizens generate 95% of code
   - Do you use AI tools in your development? (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, aider, etc.)
   - If yes, how? (code generation, debugging assistance, documentation, etc.)

4. **Deployment Evidence:**
   - Live URLs (if public-facing)
   - Screenshots/demos (if internal tools)
   - Architecture diagrams (optional but helpful)

**Why this matters:** Your public repos show experiments/learning projects, which is fine - but we need to see your professional work quality to assess fit for ScopeLock.

**Timeline:** If you can provide portfolio materials within 3-5 days, we'll complete our evaluation promptly.

Looking forward to seeing your work,
—Alexis, ScopeLock Strategic Operations"

## Additional Context for ScopeLock

**Why This Matters for ScopeLock:**

ScopeLock is an AI-augmented development agency where junior developers work WITH AI citizens (Emma, Inna, Rafael, Sofia) who generate 95% of the code. The human role is to:
- Deploy AI-generated code
- Verify quality
- Manage client relationships
- Execute with AI supervision

**This candidate fails on every dimension:**

1. **AI Workflow Absence:** Shows zero familiarity with modern AI development tools that are CORE to ScopeLock's methodology
2. **No Deployment Experience:** Claims "deploying web and mobile applications" but repos show zero evidence of production deployments
3. **Poor Quality Standards:** Inability to distinguish between scaffold and implementation suggests he couldn't verify AI-generated code quality
4. **Dishonest Presentation:** Misleading repo names and experience claims indicate integrity issues

**Risk Assessment:** **CRITICAL**

Hiring this candidate would require:
- Complete retraining on AI workflows
- Teaching basic quality standards
- Addressing potential dishonesty concerns
- Building from zero rather than leveling up existing skills

**Opportunity Cost:** Time spent training this candidate = time NOT spent finding qualified developers who already demonstrate AI-first workflows and production-quality standards.

**Final Verdict:** Hard pass. Keep searching.
