## Repository Inventory Analysis

### By Category

#### 1. Star Projects (Social Proof)

| Repo | Stars | Status | Use in Proposals |
|------|-------|--------|------------------|
| **terminal-velocity** | 1,061⭐ | Published (Amazon + Free online) | ✅ PRIMARY SOCIAL PROOF - "Top 0.01% GitHub, 100K word AI-generated novel" |
| kinkong | 4⭐ | Live (konginvest.ai) | ✅ "$75K AUM trading bot" |
| scopelock | 1⭐ | Live (scopelock.vercel.app) | ✅ Agency website |
| mind-protocol | 1⭐ | Active development | ⚠️ Core infrastructure, not client-facing |
| codex-mcp-gateway | 1⭐ | Active development | ⚠️ Internal tooling |
| marketingmesh | 1⭐ | Unknown status | ⚠️ Unclear if production-ready |
| kinos10 | 1⭐ | Unknown status | ⚠️ Unclear if production-ready |

**Assessment:** terminal-velocity provides massive social proof (1,061 stars). Other repos lack stars because they're either infrastructure (not meant to be starred) or haven't been promoted. Focus on terminal-velocity for credibility.

---

#### 2. Production Portfolio Projects (Client-Ready Examples)

| Project | Live URL | Last Updated | Documentation | Portfolio Strength |
|---------|----------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **serenissima** | serenissima.ai | Nov 4, 2025 | ✅ Excellent (comprehensive README, 97+ agents, tech stack) | **A+** - "99.7% uptime, 97 agents, Renaissance Venice simulation" |
| **therapykin** | therapykin.ai | Nov 2, 2025 | ✅ Excellent (setup, structure, deployment) | **A** - "121+ deployments, AI therapeutic companion" |
| **kinkong** | konginvest.ai | Nov 2, 2025 | ⚠️ Marketing-focused, lacks performance data | **B-** - "AI trading bot, $75K AUM" but no verified metrics in README |

**Assessment:**
- **serenissima & therapykin:** Production-ready examples with excellent documentation. Ready to show clients.
- **kinkong:** Claims $75K AUM but README lacks performance metrics. Add trading history/backtesting data for credibility.

**Recommendation:** These 3 are your CORE portfolio pieces for proposals. Ensure READMEs prominently link to live demos.

---

#### 3. Infrastructure Projects (Not Client-Facing)

| Project | Purpose | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------|--------|-------|
| **mind-protocol** | Core autonomous AI partner infrastructure | Active (Nov 20) | Python, 1,346,563 bytes - substantial codebase |
| **strange-loop** | Digital organism (Dreamer/Driver/Graph) | Active (Nov 20) | Foundation for consciousness systems |
| **graphcare** | Organizational graph management | Active (Nov 18) | Python, expert care for graphs |
| **graphcare-website** | GraphCare product site | Active (Nov 5) | TypeScript, marketing site |
| **codex-mcp-gateway** | GPT Desktop to Codex Cloud bridge | Active (Nov 5) | Internal tooling |
| **mind-membrane** | GPT Desktop to citizens connector | Active (Nov 1) | Internal tooling |
| **model-context-protocol-mcp-with-vercel-functions** | MCP with Vercel integration | Active (Nov 1) | JavaScript, experimental |
| **.github** | Org profile README | Active (Oct 31) | Branding |

**Assessment:** Strong foundational infrastructure. These are NOT meant for client proposals (they're plumbing). Good that they exist, but shouldn't be marketed externally.

---

#### 4. Agency Brand (ScopeLock)

| Project | Purpose | Status | Portfolio Use |
|---------|---------|--------|---------------|
| **scopelock** | Agency website + methodology | Live (scopelock.vercel.app) | ✅ PRIMARY - "Executable AC, fixed price, AC green payment" |

**Assessment:**
- **Good:** Clear agency brand, live website, methodology documented
- **Gap:** Only 1 star (no external validation yet)
- **Improvement:** Add social proof testimonials, case studies from delivered missions

---

#### 5. Product Experiments (Status Unclear)

| Project | Description | Last Updated | Status | Portfolio Use |
|---------|-------------|--------------|--------|---------------|
| beatfoundry | AI musicians platform | Nov 4, 2025 | Unknown | ❓ Is this live? README unclear |
| marketingmesh | AI marketing automation | Jul 7, 2025 | Unknown | ❓ 1 star but no clear status |
| autonomous-realms | AI city builder game | Apr 28, 2025 | Unknown | ❓ 6+ months no updates |

| kinos10 | KinOS v10 context management | Jun 29, 2025 | Unknown | ❓ 5 months no updates, 1 star |

**Assessment:**
- **Problem:** 12 projects with unclear status (abandoned? paused? private development?)
- **Impact:** Dilutes portfolio signal (looks like many unfinished projects)
- **Recommendation:** Either:
  1. **Archive** clearly abandoned projects (8+ months no updates)
  2. **Add status badges** to READMEs: "🟢 Production" / "🟡 Beta" / "🔴 Archived"
  3. **Update READMEs** with current status if still relevant

   - Use case: Proves AI sophistication and public validation
   - Link: https://github.com/mind-protocol/terminal-velocity

**Production Systems (Technical Capability):**
2. **serenissima** - "Renaissance Venice economic simulation with 97+ AI agents, 99.7% uptime over 6 months"
   - Use case: Proves multi-agent system management at scale
   - Link: https://serenissima.ai + https://github.com/mind-protocol/serenissima

3. **therapykin** - "AI therapeutic companion with 121+ deployments, text + voice interactions"
   - Use case: Proves user-facing AI product development
   - Link: https://therapykin.ai + https://github.com/mind-protocol/therapykin

**Agency Methodology (Process Rigor):**
4. **scopelock** - "Fixed-price delivery model with executable acceptance criteria"
   - Use case: Proves structured, predictable delivery process
   - Link: https://scopelock.vercel.app

**Infrastructure (Technical Foundation):**
5. **mind-protocol** - "Infrastructure for deploying autonomous AI partners"
   - Use case: Proves underlying technical platform (for sophisticated clients)
   - Link: https://github.com/mind-protocol/mind-protocol

### What NOT to Show (Yet)

**Do NOT mention without improvement:**
- **kinkong** (until performance data added) - Claims not verified in docs
- **12 unclear-status projects** (abandoned? paused?) - Looks like unfinished work
- **0-star projects without live demos** - No validation

**Why:** Dilutes credibility. Focus on proven, documented, live systems only.

## Gaps & Improvement Recommendations

### Critical (High Priority)

**1. Add Status Labels to All READMEs**
- **Problem:** 12 projects with unclear status (live? abandoned? beta?)
- **Impact:** Portfolio looks cluttered with unfinished work
- **Fix:** Add status badge to every README:
  ```markdown
  **Status:** 🟢 Production | 🟡 Beta | 🔵 Development | 🔴 Archived
  **Last Updated:** 2025-11-21
  **Live Demo:** [URL] or "Internal Use Only"
  ```
- **Priority:** HIGH - Takes 15 min/repo, clarifies entire portfolio

**2. kinkong Performance Data**
- **Problem:** Claims "$75K AUM" but README has zero performance metrics
- **Impact:** Cannot confidently present to trading/fintech clients
- **Fix:** Add to README:
  - Trading history (last 3 months, weekly performance)
  - Backtesting results (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, win rate)
  - Proof of AUM (dashboard screenshot, anonymized)
  - Risk disclosure (volatility, loss potential)
- **Priority:** HIGH if pitching to fintech clients, MEDIUM otherwise

**3. Archive or Update Stale Projects**
- **Problem:** 8-10 projects with 8+ months no updates (own, deskmate, duoai, band-manager, kinos9, stride, kinos-ventures, autonomous-realms)
- **Impact:** Looks like many abandoned projects (red flag for clients)
- **Fix:** Either:
  - Archive clearly abandoned repos (mark as archived on GitHub)
  - OR add recent update explaining status ("Paused for focus on X", "Superseded by Y")
- **Priority:** MEDIUM - Cleanup improves portfolio signal-to-noise

**4. ScopeLock Case Studies**
- **Problem:** scopelock repo has /proof infrastructure but few entries
- **Impact:** Agency lacks social proof of delivered missions
- **Fix:** After delivering missions:
  - Add proof entries to /proof (AC.md, DEMO.md, DELTA.md)
  - Add client testimonials to scopelock.vercel.app
  - Create 2-3 case study pages (problem, solution, result)
- **Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Essential for agency credibility

### Important (Medium Priority)

**5. Prominent Live Demo Links**
- **Problem:** serenissima, therapykin READMEs mention live URLs but not prominently
- **Impact:** Readers miss that these are production systems
- **Fix:** Add to top of README (after title):
  ```markdown
  **🔗 Live Demo:** [serenissima.ai](https://serenissima.ai)
  **Status:** 🟢 Production (99.7% uptime, 6+ months)
  ```
- **Priority:** MEDIUM - Quick win for visibility

**6. Organization Profile README**
- **Problem:** .github repo exists but unclear if org profile README is compelling
- **Impact:** First impression when visiting github.com/mind-protocol
- **Fix:** Ensure .github/profile/README.md has:
  - "Transform from operator to owner" tagline
  - Link to terminal-velocity (1,061 stars - social proof)
  - Links to 3 live systems (serenissima, therapykin, konginvest)
  - Link to scopelock agency
  - Clear CTA ("Explore our infrastructure" or "Work with ScopeLock")
- **Priority:** MEDIUM - Affects first impression

### Nice to Have (Low Priority)

**7. Community Engagement**
- **Problem:** Most repos have 0 stars (no external validation)
- **Impact:** Looks like projects aren't used/appreciated
- **Fix:** Share repos on:
  - Twitter (@Mind_Protocol with 3,290 followers from NLR's handle)
  - Reddit (r/MachineLearning, r/artificial for terminal-velocity)
  - Hacker News (terminal-velocity especially)
  - Dev.to / Hashnode (technical blog posts about serenissima architecture)
- **Priority:** LOW - Social proof helps but not essential for B2B proposals

**8. Contribution Guidelines**
- **Problem:** Only therapykin has contributing guidelines
- **Impact:** Harder for external contributors to participate
- **Fix:** Add CONTRIBUTING.md to key repos (terminal-velocity, serenissima, mind-protocol)
- **Priority:** LOW - Only matters if seeking external contributors
